Streinu,Ileana
Theran,Louis

We describe a new algorithm, the $(k,\ell)$-pebble game with colors, and use
it obtain a characterization of the family of $(k,\ell)$-sparse graphs and
algorithmic solutions to a family of problems concerning tree decompositions of
graphs. Special instances of sparse graphs appear in rigidity theory and have
received increased attention in recent years. In particular, our colored
pebbles generalize and strengthen the previous results of Lee and Streinu and
give a new proof of the Tutte-Nash-Williams characterization of arboricity. We
also present a new decomposition that certifies sparsity based on the
$(k,\ell)$-pebble game with colors. Our work also exposes connections between
pebble game algorithms and previous sparse graph algorithms by Gabow, Gabow and
Westermann and Hendrickson.

A limit relation for entropy and channel capacity per unit cost
2007-04-01

Csiszar,I.
Hiai,F.
Petz,D.

In a quantum mechanical model, Diosi, Feldmann and Kosloff arrived at a
conjecture stating that the limit of the entropy of certain mixtures is the
relative entropy as system size goes to infinity. The conjecture is proven in
this paper for density matrices. The first proof is analytic and uses the
quantum law of large numbers. The second one clarifies the relation to channel
capacity per unit cost for classical-quantum channels. Both proofs lead to
generalization of the conjecture.

Intelligent location of simultaneously active acoustic emission sources: Part I
2007-04-01

Kosel,T.
Grabec,I.

The intelligent acoustic emission locator is described in Part I, while Part
II discusses blind source separation, time delay estimation and location of two
simultaneously active continuous acoustic emission sources.
  The location of acoustic emission on complicated aircraft frame structures is
a difficult problem of non-destructive testing. This article describes an
intelligent acoustic emission source locator. The intelligent locator comprises
a sensor antenna and a general regression neural network, which solves the
location problem based on learning from examples. Locator performance was
tested on different test specimens. Tests have shown that the accuracy of
location depends on sound velocity and attenuation in the specimen, the
dimensions of the tested area, and the properties of stored data. The location
accuracy achieved by the intelligent locator is comparable to that obtained by
the conventional triangulation method, while the applicability of the
intelligent locator is more general since analysis of sonic ray paths is
avoided. This is a promising method for non-destructive testing of aircraft
frame structures by the acoustic emission method.

Intelligent location of simultaneously active acoustic emission sources: Part II
2007-04-01

Kosel,T.
Grabec,I.

Part I describes an intelligent acoustic emission locator, while Part II
discusses blind source separation, time delay estimation and location of two
continuous acoustic emission sources.
  Acoustic emission (AE) analysis is used for characterization and location of
developing defects in materials. AE sources often generate a mixture of various
statistically independent signals. A difficult problem of AE analysis is
separation and characterization of signal components when the signals from
various sources and the mode of mixing are unknown. Recently, blind source
separation (BSS) by independent component analysis (ICA) has been used to solve
these problems. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the applicability
of ICA to locate two independent simultaneously active acoustic emission
sources on an aluminum band specimen. The method is promising for
non-destructive testing of aircraft frame structures by acoustic emission
analysis.

On-line Viterbi Algorithm and Its Relationship to Random Walks
2007-03-31

Šrámek,Rastislav
Brejová,Broňa
Vinař,Tomáš

In this paper, we introduce the on-line Viterbi algorithm for decoding hidden
Markov models (HMMs) in much smaller than linear space. Our analysis on
two-state HMMs suggests that the expected maximum memory used to decode
sequence of length $n$ with $m$-state HMM can be as low as $\Theta(m\log n)$,
without a significant slow-down compared to the classical Viterbi algorithm.
Classical Viterbi algorithm requires $O(mn)$ space, which is impractical for
analysis of long DNA sequences (such as complete human genome chromosomes) and
for continuous data streams. We also experimentally demonstrate the performance
of the on-line Viterbi algorithm on a simple HMM for gene finding on both
simulated and real DNA sequences.

Sparse Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA), a variation on the standard CDMA
method in which the spreading (signature) matrix contains only a relatively

statistical physics. The analysis provides results on the performance of
maximum likelihood decoding for sparse spreading codes in the large system
limit. We present results for both cases of regular and irregular spreading
matrices for the binary additive white Gaussian noise channel (BIAWGN) with a

Capacity of a Multiple-Antenna Fading Channel with a Quantized Precoding Matrix
2007-04-02
2009-02-16
Santipach,Wiroonsak
Honig,Michael L.

Given a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channel, feedback from the
receiver can be used to specify a transmit precoding matrix, which selectively
activates the strongest channel modes. Here we analyze the performance of
Random Vector Quantization (RVQ), in which the precoding matrix is selected
from a random codebook containing independent, isotropically distributed
entries. We assume that channel elements are i.i.d. and known to the receiver,
which relays the optimal (rate-maximizing) precoder codebook index to the
transmitter using B bits. We first derive the large system capacity of
beamforming (rank-one precoding matrix) as a function of B, where large system
refers to the limit as B and the number of transmit and receive antennas all go
to infinity with fixed ratios. With beamforming RVQ is asymptotically optimal,
i.e., no other quantization scheme can achieve a larger asymptotic rate. The
performance of RVQ is also compared with that of a simpler reduced-rank scalar
quantization scheme in which the beamformer is constrained to lie in a random
subspace. We subsequently consider a precoding matrix with arbitrary rank, and
approximate the asymptotic RVQ performance with optimal and linear receivers
(matched filter and Minimum Mean Squared Error (MMSE)). Numerical examples show
that these approximations accurately predict the performance of finite-size
systems of interest. Given a target spectral efficiency, numerical examples
show that the amount of feedback required by the linear MMSE receiver is only
slightly more than that required by the optimal receiver, whereas the matched
filter can require significantly more feedback.

On Almost Periodicity Criteria for Morphic Sequences in Some Particular Cases

In some particular cases we give criteria for morphic sequences to be almost

non-erasing morphisms and with automatic sequences. In both cases a
polynomial-time algorithm solving the problem is found. A result more or less
supporting the conjecture of decidability of the general problem is given.

Geometric Complexity Theory VI: the flip via saturated and positive integer programming in representation theory and algebraic geometry
2007-04-02
2009-01-22
Mulmuley,Ketan D.

This article belongs to a series on geometric complexity theory (GCT), an
approach to the P vs. NP and related problems through algebraic geometry and
representation theory. The basic principle behind this approach is called the
flip. In essence, it reduces the negative hypothesis in complexity theory (the
lower bound problems), such as the P vs. NP problem in characteristic zero, to
the positive hypothesis in complexity theory (the upper bound problems):
specifically, to showing that the problems of deciding nonvanishing of the
fundamental structural constants in representation theory and algebraic
geometry, such as the well known plethysm constants--or rather certain relaxed
forms of these decision probelms--belong to the complexity class P. In this
article, we suggest a plan for implementing the flip, i.e., for showing that
these relaxed decision problems belong to P. This is based on the reduction of
the preceding complexity-theoretic positive hypotheses to mathematical
positivity hypotheses: specifically, to showing that there exist positive
formulae--i.e. formulae with nonnegative coefficients--for the structural
constants under consideration and certain functions associated with them. These
turn out be intimately related to the similar positivity properties of the
Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials and the multiplicative structural constants of the
canonical (global crystal) bases in the theory of Drinfeld-Jimbo quantum
groups. The known proofs of these positivity properties depend on the Riemann
hypothesis over finite fields and the related results. Thus the reduction here,
in conjunction with the flip, in essence, says that the validity of the P vs.
NP conjecture in characteristic zero is intimately linked to the Riemann
hypothesis over finite fields and related problems.

This paper considers the use of punctured convolutional codes to obtain

approximated metrics without increasing the complexity of the decoding
operations.

Differential Recursion and Differentially Algebraic Functions
2007-04-03

Kawamura,Akitoshi

Moore introduced a class of real-valued "recursive" functions by analogy with
Kleene's formulation of the standard recursive functions. While his concise
definition inspired a new line of research on analog computation, it contains
some technical inaccuracies. Focusing on his "primitive recursive" functions,
we pin down what is problematic and discuss possible attempts to remove the
ambiguity regarding the behavior of the differential recursion operator on
partial functions. It turns out that in any case the purported relation to
differentially algebraic functions, and hence to Shannon's model of analog
computation, fails.

The World as Evolving Information
2007-04-02

Gershenson,Carlos

This paper discusses the benefits of describing the world as information,
especially in the study of the evolution of life and cognition. Traditional
studies encounter problems because it is difficult to describe life and
cognition in terms of matter and energy, since their laws are valid only at the
physical scale. However, if matter and energy, as well as life and cognition,
are described in terms of information, evolution can be described consistently
as information becoming more complex.
  The paper presents eight tentative laws of information, valid at multiple
scales, which are generalizations of Darwinian, cybernetic, thermodynamic,
psychological, philosophical, and complexity principles. These are further used
to discuss the notions of life, cognition and their evolution.

The Complexity of HCP in Digraps with Degree Bound Two

Zhu,Guohun

The Hamiltonian cycle problem (HCP) in digraphs D with degree bound two is
solved by two mappings in this paper. The first bijection is between an
incidence matrix C_{nm} of simple digraph and an incidence matrix F of balanced
bipartite undirected graph G; The second mapping is from a perfect matching of
G to a cycle of D. It proves that the complexity of HCP in D is polynomial, and
finding a second non-isomorphism Hamiltonian cycle from a given Hamiltonian
digraph with degree bound two is also polynomial. Lastly it deduces P=NP base
on the results.

Pseudo-random Puncturing: A Technique to Lower the Error Floor of Turbo Codes
2007-04-03

Chatzigeorgiou,Ioannis
Rodrigues,Miguel R. D.
Wassell,Ian J.
Carrasco,Rolando

It has been observed that particular rate-1/2 partially systematic parallel
concatenated convolutional codes (PCCCs) can achieve a lower error floor than
that of their rate-1/3 parent codes. Nevertheless, good puncturing patterns can
only be identified by means of an exhaustive search, whilst convergence towards
low bit error probabilities can be problematic when the systematic output of a
rate-1/2 partially systematic PCCC is heavily punctured. In this paper, we
present and study a family of rate-1/2 partially systematic PCCCs, which we
call pseudo-randomly punctured codes. We evaluate their bit error rate
performance and we show that they always yield a lower error floor than that of
their rate-1/3 parent codes. Furthermore, we compare analytic results to
simulations and we demonstrate that their performance converges towards the
error floor region, owning to the moderate puncturing of their systematic
output. Consequently, we propose pseudo-random puncturing as a means of
improving the bandwidth efficiency of a PCCC and simultaneously lowering its
error floor.

Inapproximability of Maximum Weighted Edge Biclique and Its Applications
2007-04-03
2009-03-22
Tan,Jinsong

Given a bipartite graph $G = (V_1,V_2,E)$ where edges take on {\it both}
positive and negative weights from set $\mathcal{S}$, the {\it maximum weighted
edge biclique} problem, or $\mathcal{S}$-MWEB for short, asks to find a
bipartite subgraph whose sum of edge weights is maximized. This problem has
various applications in bioinformatics, machine learning and databases and its
(in)approximability remains open. In this paper, we show that for a wide range
of choices of $\mathcal{S}$, specifically when $| \frac{\min\mathcal{S}} {\max
\mathcal{S}} | \in \Omega(\eta^{\delta-1/2}) \cap O(\eta^{1/2-\delta})$ (where
$\eta = \max\{|V_1|, |V_2|\}$, and $\delta \in (0,1/2]$), no polynomial time
algorithm can approximate $\mathcal{S}$-MWEB within a factor of $n^{\epsilon}$
for some $\epsilon > 0$ unless $\mathsf{RP = NP}$. This hardness result gives
justification of the heuristic approaches adopted for various applied problems
in the aforementioned areas, and indicates that good approximation algorithms
are unlikely to exist. Specifically, we give two applications by showing that:
1) finding statistically significant biclusters in the SAMBA model, proposed in
\cite{Tan02} for the analysis of microarray data, is
$n^{\epsilon}$-inapproximable; and 2) no polynomial time algorithm exists for
the Minimum Description Length with Holes problem \cite{Bu05} unless
$\mathsf{RP=NP}$.

Refuting the Pseudo Attack on the REESSE1+ Cryptosystem

We illustrate through example 1 and 2 that the condition at theorem 1 in [8]
dissatisfies necessity, and the converse proposition of fact 1.1 in [8] does
not hold, namely the condition Z/M - L/Ak < 1/(2 Ak^2) is not sufficient for
f(i) + f(j) = f(k). Illuminate through an analysis and ex.3 that there is a
logic error during deduction of fact 1.2, which causes each of fact 1.2, 1.3, 4
to be invalid. Demonstrate through ex.4 and 5 that each or the combination of
qu+1 > qu * D at fact 4 and table 1 at fact 2.2 is not sufficient for f(i) +
f(j) = f(k), property 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 each are invalid, and alg.1 based on fact 4
and alg.2 based on table 1 are disordered and wrong logically. Further,
manifest through a repeated experiment and ex.5 that the data at table 2 is
falsified, and the example in [8] is woven elaborately. We explain why Cx = Ax
* W^f(x) (% M) is changed to Cx = (Ax * W^f(x))^d (% M) in REESSE1+ v2.1. To
the signature fraud, we point out that [8] misunderstands the existence of T^-1
and Q^-1 % (M-1), and forging of Q can be easily avoided through moving H.
Therefore, the conclusion of [8] that REESSE1+ is not secure at all (which
connotes that [8] can extract a related private key from any public key in
REESSE1+) is fully incorrect, and as long as the parameter Omega is fitly
selected, REESSE1+ with Cx = Ax * W^f(x) (% M) is secure.

Optimal Routing for Decode-and-Forward based Cooperation in Wireless Networks
2007-04-04

Ong,Lawrence
Motani,Mehul

We investigate cooperative wireless relay networks in which the nodes can
help each other in data transmission. We study different coding strategies in
the single-source single-destination network with many relay nodes. Given the
myriad of ways in which nodes can cooperate, there is a natural routing
problem, i.e., determining an ordered set of nodes to relay the data from the
source to the destination. We find that for a given route, the
decode-and-forward strategy, which is an information theoretic cooperative
coding strategy, achieves rates significantly higher than that achievable by
the usual multi-hop coding strategy, which is a point-to-point non-cooperative
coding strategy. We construct an algorithm to find an optimal route (in terms
of rate maximizing) for the decode-and-forward strategy. Since the algorithm
runs in factorial time in the worst case, we propose a heuristic algorithm that
runs in polynomial time. The heuristic algorithm outputs an optimal route when
the nodes transmit independent codewords. We implement these coding strategies
using practical low density parity check codes to compare the performance of
the strategies on different routes.

Many-to-One Throughput Capacity of IEEE 802.11 Multi-hop Wireless Networks
2007-04-04

Chan,Chi Pan
Liew,Soung Chang
Chan,An

This paper investigates the many-to-one throughput capacity (and by symmetry,
one-to-many throughput capacity) of IEEE 802.11 multi-hop networks. It has
generally been assumed in prior studies that the many-to-one throughput
capacity is upper-bounded by the link capacity L. Throughput capacity L is not
achievable under 802.11. This paper introduces the notion of "canonical
networks", which is a class of regularly-structured networks whose capacities
can be analyzed more easily than unstructured networks. We show that the
throughput capacity of canonical networks under 802.11 has an analytical upper
bound of 3L/4 when the source nodes are two or more hops away from the sink;
and simulated throughputs of 0.690L (0.740L) when the source nodes are many
hops away. We conjecture that 3L/4 is also the upper bound for general
networks. When all links have equal length, 2L/3 can be shown to be the upper
bound for general networks. Our simulations show that 802.11 networks with
random topologies operated with AODV routing can only achieve throughputs far
below the upper bounds. Fortunately, by properly selecting routes near the
gateway (or by properly positioning the relay nodes leading to the gateway) to
fashion after the structure of canonical networks, the throughput can be
improved significantly by more than 150%. Indeed, in a dense network, it is
worthwhile to deactivate some of the relay nodes near the sink judiciously.

On the Achievable Rate Regions for Interference Channels with Degraded Message Sets
2007-04-04
2007-04-04
Jiang,Jinhua
Yan,Xin

The interference channel with degraded message sets (IC-DMS) refers to a
communication model in which two senders attempt to communicate with their
respective receivers simultaneously through a common medium, and one of the
senders has complete and a priori (non-causal) knowledge about the message
being transmitted by the other. A coding scheme that collectively has
advantages of cooperative coding, collaborative coding, and dirty paper coding,
is developed for such a channel. With resorting to this coding scheme,
achievable rate regions of the IC-DMS in both discrete memoryless and Gaussian
cases are derived, which, in general, include several previously known rate
regions. Numerical examples for the Gaussian case demonstrate that in the
high-interference-gain regime, the derived achievable rate regions offer
considerable improvements over these existing results.

Learning from compressed observations
2007-04-04

Raginsky,Maxim

The problem of statistical learning is to construct a predictor of a random
variable $Y$ as a function of a related random variable $X$ on the basis of an
i.i.d. training sample from the joint distribution of $(X,Y)$. Allowable
predictors are drawn from some specified class, and the goal is to approach
asymptotically the performance (expected loss) of the best predictor in the
class. We consider the setting in which one has perfect observation of the
$X$-part of the sample, while the $Y$-part has to be communicated at some
finite bit rate. The encoding of the $Y$-values is allowed to depend on the
$X$-values. Under suitable regularity conditions on the admissible predictors,
the underlying family of probability distributions and the loss function, we
give an information-theoretic characterization of achievable predictor
performance in terms of conditional distortion-rate functions. The ideas are
illustrated on the example of nonparametric regression in Gaussian noise.

Revisiting the Issues On Netflow Sample and Export Performance
2007-04-05

Haddadi,Hamed
Landa,Raul
Rio,Miguel
Bhatti,Saleem

The high volume of packets and packet rates of traffic on some router links
makes it exceedingly difficult for routers to examine every packet in order to
keep detailed statistics about the traffic which is traversing the router.
Sampling is commonly applied on routers in order to limit the load incurred by
the collection of information that the router has to undertake when evaluating
flow information for monitoring purposes. The sampling process in nearly all
cases is a deterministic process of choosing 1 in every N packets on a
per-interface basis, and then forming the flow statistics based on the
collected sampled statistics. Even though this sampling may not be significant
for some statistics, such as packet rate, others can be severely distorted.
However, it is important to consider the sampling techniques and their relative
accuracy when applied to different traffic patterns. The main disadvantage of
sampling is the loss of accuracy in the collected trace when compared to the
original traffic stream. To date there has not been a detailed analysis of the
impact of sampling at a router in various traffic profiles and flow criteria.
In this paper, we assess the performance of the sampling process as used in
NetFlow in detail, and we discuss some techniques for the compensation of loss
of monitoring detail.

algorithm. We give several illustrative examples of derived algorithms with two
component algorithms. We include mean execution time solutions for
two-algorithm processors whose joint density of execution times are of several
general forms. For the case in which the joint density for a two-algorithm
processor is a step function, we give a maximum-likelihood estimation scheme
with which to analyze empirical processing time data.

Hybrid-ARQ in Multihop Networks with Opportunistic Relay Selection
2007-04-05

Lo,Caleb K.
Heath,Robert W.
Vishwanath,Sriram

This paper develops a contention-based opportunistic feedback technique
towards relay selection in a dense wireless network. This technique enables the
forwarding of additional parity information from the selected relay to the
destination. For a given network, the effects of varying key parameters such as
the feedback probability are presented and discussed. A primary advantage of
the proposed technique is that relay selection can be performed in a
distributed way. Simulation results find its performance to closely match that
of centralized schemes that utilize GPS information, unlike the proposed
method. The proposed relay selection method is also found to achieve throughput
gains over a point-to-point transmission strategy.

Opportunistic Relay Selection with Limited Feedback
2007-04-05

Lo,Caleb K.
Heath,Robert W.
Vishwanath,Sriram

It has been shown that a decentralized relay selection protocol based on
opportunistic feedback from the relays yields good throughput performance in
dense wireless networks. This selection strategy supports a hybrid-ARQ
transmission approach where relays forward parity information to the
destination in the event of a decoding error. Such an approach, however,
suffers a loss compared to centralized strategies that select relays with the
best channel gain to the destination. This paper closes the performance gap by
adding another level of channel feedback to the decentralized relay selection
problem. It is demonstrated that only one additional bit of feedback is
necessary for good throughput performance. The performance impact of varying
key parameters such as the number of relays and the channel feedback threshold
is discussed. An accompanying bit error rate analysis demonstrates the
importance of relay selection.

On packet lengths and overhead for random linear coding over the erasure channel
2007-04-05

Shrader,Brooke
Ephremides,Anthony

We assess the practicality of random network coding by illuminating the issue
of overhead and considering it in conjunction with increasingly long packets
sent over the erasure channel. We show that the transmission of increasingly
long packets, consisting of either of an increasing number of symbols per
packet or an increasing symbol alphabet size, results in a data rate
approaching zero over the erasure channel. This result is due to an erasure
probability that increases with packet length. Numerical results for a
particular modulation scheme demonstrate a data rate of approximately zero for
a large, but finite-length packet. Our results suggest a reduction in the
performance gains offered by random network coding.

P-adic arithmetic coding

A new incremental algorithm for data compression is presented. For a sequence
of input symbols algorithm incrementally constructs a p-adic integer number as
an output. Decoding process starts with less significant part of a p-adic
integer and incrementally reconstructs a sequence of input symbols. Algorithm
is based on certain features of p-adic numbers and p-adic norm. p-adic coding
algorithm may be considered as of generalization a popular compression
technique - arithmetic coding algorithms. It is shown that for p = 2 the
algorithm works as integer variant of arithmetic coding; for a special class of
models it gives exactly the same codes as Huffman's algorithm, for another
special model and a specific alphabet it gives Golomb-Rice codes.

Universal Source Coding for Monotonic and Fast Decaying Monotonic Distributions
2007-04-05

Shamir,Gil I.

We study universal compression of sequences generated by monotonic
distributions. We show that for a monotonic distribution over an alphabet of
size $k$, each probability parameter costs essentially $0.5 \log (n/k^3)$ bits,
where $n$ is the coded sequence length, as long as $k = o(n^{1/3})$. Otherwise,
for $k = O(n)$, the total average sequence redundancy is $O(n^{1/3+\epsilon})$
bits overall. We then show that there exists a sub-class of monotonic
distributions over infinite alphabets for which redundancy of
$O(n^{1/3+\epsilon})$ bits overall is still achievable. This class contains
fast decaying distributions, including many distributions over the integers and
geometric distributions. For some slower decays, including other distributions
over the integers, redundancy of $o(n)$ bits overall is achievable, where a
method to compute specific redundancy rates for such distributions is derived.
The results are specifically true for finite entropy monotonic distributions.
Finally, we study individual sequence redundancy behavior assuming a sequence
is governed by a monotonic distribution. We show that for sequences whose
empirical distributions are monotonic, individual redundancy bounds similar to
those in the average case can be obtained. However, even if the monotonicity in
the empirical distribution is violated, diminishing per symbol individual
sequence redundancies with respect to the monotonic maximum likelihood
description length may still be achievable.

This paper presents an experimental study and the lessons learned from the
observation of the attackers when logged on a compromised machine. The results
are based on a six months period during which a controlled experiment has been
run with a high interaction honeypot. We correlate our findings with those
obtained with a worldwide distributed system of lowinteraction honeypots.

Availability assessment of SunOS/Solaris Unix Systems based on Syslogd and wtmpx logfiles : a case study
2007-04-06

Simache,Cristina
Kaaniche,Mohamed

This paper presents a measurement-based availability assessment study using
field data collected during a 4-year period from 373 SunOS/Solaris Unix
workstations and servers interconnected through a local area network. We focus
on the estimation of machine uptimes, downtimes and availability based on the
identification of failures that caused total service loss. Data corresponds to
syslogd event logs that contain a large amount of information about the normal
activity of the studied systems as well as their behavior in the presence of
failures. It is widely recognized that the information contained in such event
logs might be incomplete or imperfect. The solution investigated in this paper
to address this problem is based on the use of auxiliary sources of data
obtained from wtmpx files maintained by the SunOS/Solaris Unix operating
system. The results obtained suggest that the combined use of wtmpx and syslogd
log files provides more complete information on the state of the target systems
that is useful to provide availability estimations that better reflect reality.

Honeypots are more and more used to collect data on malicious activities on
the Internet and to better understand the strategies and techniques used by
attackers to compromise target systems. Analysis and modeling methodologies are
needed to support the characterization of attack processes based on the data
collected from the honeypots. This paper presents some empirical analyses based
on the data collected from the Leurr{\'e}.com honeypot platforms deployed on
the Internet and presents some preliminary modeling studies aimed at fulfilling

An architecture-based dependability modeling framework using AADL
2007-04-06

Rugina,Ana-Elena
Kanoun,Karama
Kaaniche,Mohamed

For efficiency reasons, the software system designers' will is to use an
integrated set of methods and tools to describe specifications and designs, and
also to perform analyses such as dependability, schedulability and performance.
AADL (Architecture Analysis and Design Language) has proved to be efficient for
software architecture modeling. In addition, AADL was designed to accommodate
several types of analyses. This paper presents an iterative dependency-driven
approach for dependability modeling using AADL. It is illustrated on a small
example. This approach is part of a complete framework that allows the
generation of dependability analysis and evaluation models from AADL models to
support the analysis of software and system architectures, in critical
application domains.

A Hierarchical Approach for Dependability Analysis of a Commercial Cache-Based RAID Storage Architecture
2007-04-06

Kaaniche,Mohamed
Romano,Luigi
Kalbarczyk,Zbigniew
Iyer,Ravishankar
Karcich,Rick

We present a hierarchical simulation approach for the dependability analysis
and evaluation of a highly available commercial cache-based RAID storage
system. The archi-tecture is complex and includes several layers of
overlap-ping error detection and recovery mechanisms. Three ab-straction levels
have been developed to model the cache architecture, cache operations, and
error detection and recovery mechanism. The impact of faults and errors
oc-curring in the cache and in the disks is analyzed at each level of the
hierarchy. A simulation submodel is associated with each abstraction level. The
models have been devel-oped using DEPEND, a simulation-based environment for
system-level dependability analysis, which provides facili-ties to inject
faults into a functional behavior model, to simulate error detection and
recovery mechanisms, and to evaluate quantitative measures. Several fault
models are defined for each submodel to simulate cache component failures, disk
failures, transmission errors, and data errors in the cache memory and in the
disks. Some of the parame-ters characterizing fault injection in a given
submodel cor-respond to probabilities evaluated from the simulation of the
lower-level submodel. Based on the proposed method-ology, we evaluate and
analyze 1) the system behavior un-der a real workload and high error rate
(focusing on error bursts), 2) the coverage of the error detection mechanisms
implemented in the system and the error latency distribu-tions, and 3) the
accumulation of errors in the cache and in the disks.

Sensor Networks with Random Links: Topology Design for Distributed Consensus
2007-04-06

Kar,Soummya
Moura,Jose M. F.

In a sensor network, in practice, the communication among sensors is subject
to:(1) errors or failures at random times; (3) costs; and(2) constraints since
sensors and networks operate under scarce resources, such as power, data rate,
or communication. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is usually a main factor in
determining the probability of error (or of communication failure) in a link.
These probabilities are then a proxy for the SNR under which the links operate.
The paper studies the problem of designing the topology, i.e., assigning the
probabilities of reliable communication among sensors (or of link failures) to
maximize the rate of convergence of average consensus, when the link
communication costs are taken into account, and there is an overall
communication budget constraint. To consider this problem, we address a number
of preliminary issues: (1) model the network as a random topology; (2)
establish necessary and sufficient conditions for mean square sense (mss) and
almost sure (a.s.) convergence of average consensus when network links fail;
and, in particular, (3) show that a necessary and sufficient condition for both
mss and a.s. convergence is for the algebraic connectivity of the mean graph
describing the network topology to be strictly positive. With these results, we
formulate topology design, subject to random link failures and to a
communication cost constraint, as a constrained convex optimization problem to
which we apply semidefinite programming techniques. We show by an extensive
numerical study that the optimal design improves significantly the convergence
speed of the consensus algorithm and can achieve the asymptotic performance of
a non-random network at a fraction of the communication cost.

Cross-Layer Optimization of MIMO-Based Mesh Networks with Gaussian Vector Broadcast Channels
2007-04-06

Liu,Jia
Hou,Y. Thomas

MIMO technology is one of the most significant advances in the past decade to
increase channel capacity and has a great potential to improve network capacity
for mesh networks. In a MIMO-based mesh network, the links outgoing from each
node sharing the common communication spectrum can be modeled as a Gaussian
vector broadcast channel. Recently, researchers showed that ``dirty paper
coding'' (DPC) is the optimal transmission strategy for Gaussian vector
broadcast channels. So far, there has been little study on how this fundamental
result will impact the cross-layer design for MIMO-based mesh networks. To fill
this gap, we consider the problem of jointly optimizing DPC power allocation in
the link layer at each node and multihop/multipath routing in a MIMO-based mesh
networks. It turns out that this optimization problem is a very challenging
non-convex problem. To address this difficulty, we transform the original
problem to an equivalent problem by exploiting the channel duality. For the
transformed problem, we develop an efficient solution procedure that integrates
Lagrangian dual decomposition method, conjugate gradient projection method
based on matrix differential calculus, cutting-plane method, and subgradient
method. In our numerical example, it is shown that we can achieve a network
performance gain of 34.4% by using DPC.

Architecture for Pseudo Acausal Evolvable Embedded Systems

Abubakr,Mohd
Vinay,R. M.

Advances in semiconductor technology are contributing to the increasing
complexity in the design of embedded systems. Architectures with novel
techniques such as evolvable nature and autonomous behavior have engrossed lot
of attention. This paper demonstrates conceptually evolvable embedded systems
can be characterized basing on acausal nature. It is noted that in acausal
systems, future input needs to be known, here we make a mechanism such that the
system predicts the future inputs and exhibits pseudo acausal nature. An
embedded system that uses theoretical framework of acausality is proposed. Our
method aims at a novel architecture that features the hardware evolability and
autonomous behavior alongside pseudo acausality. Various aspects of this
architecture are discussed in detail along with the limitations.

The on-line shortest path problem under partial monitoring
2007-04-08

Gyorgy,Andras
Linder,Tamas
Lugosi,Gabor
Ottucsak,Gyorgy

The on-line shortest path problem is considered under various models of
partial monitoring. Given a weighted directed acyclic graph whose edge weights
can change in an arbitrary (adversarial) way, a decision maker has to choose in
each round of a game a path between two distinguished vertices such that the
loss of the chosen path (defined as the sum of the weights of its composing
edges) be as small as possible. In a setting generalizing the multi-armed
bandit problem, after choosing a path, the decision maker learns only the
weights of those edges that belong to the chosen path. For this problem, an
algorithm is given whose average cumulative loss in n rounds exceeds that of
the best path, matched off-line to the entire sequence of the edge weights, by
a quantity that is proportional to 1/\sqrt{n} and depends only polynomially on
the number of edges of the graph. The algorithm can be implemented with linear
complexity in the number of rounds n and in the number of edges. An extension
to the so-called label efficient setting is also given, in which the decision
maker is informed about the weights of the edges corresponding to the chosen
path at a total of m << n time instances. Another extension is shown where the
decision maker competes against a time-varying path, a generalization of the
problem of tracking the best expert. A version of the multi-armed bandit
setting for shortest path is also discussed where the decision maker learns
only the total weight of the chosen path but not the weights of the individual
edges on the path. Applications to routing in packet switched networks along
with simulation results are also presented.

A neural network approach to ordinal regression
2007-04-08

Cheng,Jianlin

Ordinal regression is an important type of learning, which has properties of
both classification and regression. Here we describe a simple and effective
approach to adapt a traditional neural network to learn ordinal categories. Our
approach is a generalization of the perceptron method for ordinal regression.
On several benchmark datasets, our method (NNRank) outperforms a neural network
classification method. Compared with the ordinal regression methods using
Gaussian processes and support vector machines, NNRank achieves comparable
performance. Moreover, NNRank has the advantages of traditional neural
networks: learning in both online and batch modes, handling very large training
datasets, and making rapid predictions. These features make NNRank a useful and
complementary tool for large-scale data processing tasks such as information
retrieval, web page ranking, collaborative filtering, and protein ranking in
Bioinformatics.

On the Kolmogorov-Chaitin Complexity for short sequences
2007-04-08
2010-12-16
Delahaye,Jean-Paul
Zenil,Hector

A drawback of Kolmogorov-Chaitin complexity (K) as a function from s to the
shortest program producing s is its noncomputability which limits its range of
applicability. Moreover, when strings are short, the dependence of K on a
particular universal Turing machine U can be arbitrary. In practice one can
approximate it by computable compression methods. However, such compression
methods do not always provide meaningful approximations--for strings shorter,
for example, than typical compiler lengths. In this paper we suggest an
empirical approach to overcome this difficulty and to obtain a stable
definition of the Kolmogorov-Chaitin complexity for short sequences.
Additionally, a correlation in terms of distribution frequencies was found
across the output of two models of abstract machines, namely unidimensional
cellular automata and deterministic Turing machine.

Efficiently computing fast paths in large scale dynamic road networks (where

shortest path algorithm for static large-scale networks; we maintain a static

Differential Diversity Reception of MDPSK over Independent Rayleigh Channels with Nonidentical Branch Statistics and Asymmetric Fading Spectrum
2007-04-09

Fu,Hua
Kam,Pooi Yuen

This paper is concerned with optimum diversity receiver structure and its
performance analysis of differential phase shift keying (DPSK) with
differential detection over nonselective, independent, nonidentically
distributed, Rayleigh fading channels. The fading process in each branch is
assumed to have an arbitrary Doppler spectrum with arbitrary Doppler bandwidth,
but to have distinct, asymmetric fading power spectral density characteristic.
Using 8-DPSK as an example, the average bit error probability (BEP) of the
optimum diversity receiver is obtained by calculating the BEP for each of the
three individual bits. The BEP results derived are given in exact, explicit,
closed-form expressions which show clearly the behavior of the performance as a
function of various system parameters.

Novelty and Collective Attention

Wu,Fang
Huberman,Bernardo A.

The subject of collective attention is central to an information age where
millions of people are inundated with daily messages. It is thus of interest to
understand how attention to novel items propagates and eventually fades among
large populations. We have analyzed the dynamics of collective attention among
one million users of an interactive website -- \texttt{digg.com} -- devoted to
thousands of novel news stories. The observations can be described by a
dynamical model characterized by a single novelty factor. Our measurements
indicate that novelty within groups decays with a stretched-exponential law,
suggesting the existence of a natural time scale over which attention fades.

Novel algorithm to calculate hypervolume indicator of Pareto approximation set
2007-04-10

Yang,Qing
Ding,Shengchao

Hypervolume indicator is a commonly accepted quality measure for comparing
Pareto approximation set generated by multi-objective optimizers. The best
known algorithm to calculate it for $n$ points in $d$-dimensional space has a
run time of $O(n^{d/2})$ with special data structures. This paper presents a
recursive, vertex-splitting algorithm for calculating the hypervolume indicator
of a set of $n$ non-comparable points in $d>2$ dimensions. It splits out
multiple child hyper-cuboids which can not be dominated by a splitting
reference point. In special, the splitting reference point is carefully chosen
to minimize the number of points in the child hyper-cuboids. The complexity
analysis shows that the proposed algorithm achieves $O((\frac{d}{2})^n)$ time
and $O(dn^2)$ space complexity in the worst case.

A Doubly Distributed Genetic Algorithm for Network Coding

Kim,Minkyu
Aggarwal,Varun
O'Reilly,Una-May
Medard,Muriel

We present a genetic algorithm which is distributed in two novel ways: along
genotype and temporal axes. Our algorithm first distributes, for every member
of the population, a subset of the genotype to each network node, rather than a
subset of the population to each. This genotype distribution is shown to offer
a significant gain in running time. Then, for efficient use of the
computational resources in the network, our algorithm divides the candidate
solutions into pipelined sets and thus the distribution is in the temporal
domain, rather that in the spatial domain. This temporal distribution may lead
to temporal inconsistency in selection and replacement, however our experiments
yield better efficiency in terms of the time to convergence without incurring
significant penalties.

Text Line Segmentation of Historical Documents: a Survey

automatic reading of complete pages remains, in most cases, a long-term
objective, tasks such as word spotting, text/image alignment, authentication
and extraction of specific fields are in use today. For all these tasks, a
major step is document segmentation into text lines. Because of the low quality
and the complexity of these documents (background noise, artifacts due to
aging, interfering lines),automatic text line segmentation remains an open
research field. The objective of this paper is to present a survey of existing
methods, developed during the last decade, and dedicated to documents of
historical interest.

Phase Transitions in the Coloring of Random Graphs
2007-04-10
2007-06-20
Zdeborová,Lenka
Krzakala,Florent

We consider the problem of coloring the vertices of a large sparse random
graph with a given number of colors so that no adjacent vertices have the same
color. Using the cavity method, we present a detailed and systematic analytical
study of the space of proper colorings (solutions).
  We show that for a fixed number of colors and as the average vertex degree
(number of constraints) increases, the set of solutions undergoes several phase
transitions similar to those observed in the mean field theory of glasses.
First, at the clustering transition, the entropically dominant part of the
phase space decomposes into an exponential number of pure states so that beyond
this transition a uniform sampling of solutions becomes hard. Afterward, the
space of solutions condenses over a finite number of the largest states and
consequently the total entropy of solutions becomes smaller than the annealed
one. Another transition takes place when in all the entropically dominant
states a finite fraction of nodes freezes so that each of these nodes is
allowed a single color in all the solutions inside the state. Eventually, above
the coloring threshold, no more solutions are available. We compute all the
critical connectivities for Erdos-Renyi and regular random graphs and determine
their asymptotic values for large number of colors.
  Finally, we discuss the algorithmic consequences of our findings. We argue
that the onset of computational hardness is not associated with the clustering
transition and we suggest instead that the freezing transition might be the
relevant phenomenon. We also discuss the performance of a simple local Walk-COL
algorithm and of the belief propagation algorithm in the light of our results.

Parametric Learning and Monte Carlo Optimization
2007-04-10

Wolpert,David H.
Rajnarayan,Dev G.

This paper uncovers and explores the close relationship between Monte Carlo
Optimization of a parametrized integral (MCO), Parametric machine-Learning
(PL), and `blackbox' or `oracle'-based optimization (BO). We make four
contributions. First, we prove that MCO is mathematically identical to a broad
class of PL problems. This identity potentially provides a new application
domain for all broadly applicable PL techniques: MCO. Second, we introduce
immediate sampling, a new version of the Probability Collectives (PC) algorithm
for blackbox optimization. Immediate sampling transforms the original BO
problem into an MCO problem. Accordingly, by combining these first two
contributions, we can apply all PL techniques to BO. In our third contribution
we validate this way of improving BO by demonstrating that cross-validation and
bagging improve immediate sampling. Finally, conventional MC and MCO procedures
ignore the relationship between the sample point locations and the associated
values of the integrand; only the values of the integrand at those locations
are considered. We demonstrate that one can exploit the sample location
information using PL techniques, for example by forming a fit of the sample
locations to the associated values of the integrand. This provides an
additional way to apply PL techniques to improve MCO.

A Disciplined Approach to Adopting Agile Practices: The Agile Adoption Framework

Many organizations aspire to adopt agile processes to take advantage of the
numerous benefits that it offers to an organization. Those benefits include,
but are not limited to, quicker return on investment, better software quality,
and higher customer satisfaction. To date however, there is no structured
process (at least in the public domain) that guides organizations in adopting
agile practices. To address this problem we present the Agile Adoption
Framework. The framework consists of two components: an agile measurement
index, and a 4-Stage process, that together guide and assist the agile adoption
efforts of organizations. More specifically, the agile measurement index is
used to identify the agile potential of projects and organizations. The 4-Stage
process, on the other hand, helps determine (a) whether or not organizations
are ready for agile adoption, and (b) guided by their potential, what set of
agile practices can and should be introduced.

Antenna Combining for the MIMO Downlink Channel
2007-04-10
2007-08-19
Jindal,Nihar

A multiple antenna downlink channel where limited channel feedback is
available to the transmitter is considered. In a vector downlink channel
(single antenna at each receiver), the transmit antenna array can be used to
transmit separate data streams to multiple receivers only if the transmitter
has very accurate channel knowledge, i.e., if there is high-rate channel
feedback from each receiver. In this work it is shown that channel feedback
requirements can be significantly reduced if each receiver has a small number
of antennas and appropriately combines its antenna outputs. A combining method
that minimizes channel quantization error at each receiver, and thereby
minimizes multi-user interference, is proposed and analyzed. This technique is
shown to outperform traditional techniques such as maximum-ratio combining
because minimization of interference power is more critical than maximization
of signal power in the multiple antenna downlink. Analysis is provided to
quantify the feedback savings, and the technique is seen to work well with user
selection and is also robust to receiver estimation error.

Low Density Lattice Codes

Shalvi,Ofir

Low density lattice codes (LDLC) are novel lattice codes that can be decoded
efficiently and approach the capacity of the additive white Gaussian noise
(AWGN) channel. In LDLC a codeword x is generated directly at the n-dimensional
Euclidean space as a linear transformation of a corresponding integer message
vector b, i.e., x = Gb, where H, the inverse of G, is restricted to be sparse.
The fact that H is sparse is utilized to develop a linear-time iterative
decoding scheme which attains, as demonstrated by simulations, good error
performance within ~0.5dB from capacity at block length of n = 100,000 symbols.
The paper also discusses convergence results and implementation considerations.

A Language-Based Approach for Improving the Robustness of Network Application Protocol Implementations
2007-04-11

Laurent,Burgy
Réveillère,Laurent
Lawall,Julia
Muller,Gilles

The secure and robust functioning of a network relies on the defect-free
implementation of network applications. As network protocols have become
increasingly complex, however, hand-writing network message processing code has
become increasingly error-prone. In this paper, we present a domain-specific
language, Zebu, for describing protocol message formats and related processing
constraints. From a Zebu specification, a compiler automatically generates
stubs to be used by an application to parse network messages. Zebu is easy to
use, as it builds on notations used in RFCs to describe protocol grammars. Zebu
is also efficient, as the memory usage is tailored to application needs and
message fragments can be specified to be processed on demand. Finally,
Zebu-based applications are robust, as the Zebu compiler automatically checks
specification consistency and generates parsing stubs that include validation
of the message structure. Using a mutation analysis in the context of SIP and
RTSP, we show that Zebu significantly improves application robustness.

A Better Good-Turing Estimator for Sequence Probabilities

Wagner,Aaron B.

Kulkarni,Sanjeev R.

We consider the problem of estimating the probability of an observed string
drawn i.i.d. from an unknown distribution. The key feature of our study is that
the length of the observed string is assumed to be of the same order as the
size of the underlying alphabet. In this setting, many letters are unseen and
the empirical distribution tends to overestimate the probability of the
observed letters. To overcome this problem, the traditional approach to
probability estimation is to use the classical Good-Turing estimator. We
introduce a natural scaling model and use it to show that the Good-Turing
sequence probability estimator is not consistent. We then introduce a novel
sequence probability estimator that is indeed consistent under the natural
scaling model.

GLRT-Optimal Noncoherent Lattice Decoding

This paper presents new low-complexity lattice-decoding algorithms for
noncoherent block detection of QAM and PAM signals over complex-valued fading
channels. The algorithms are optimal in terms of the generalized likelihood
ratio test (GLRT). The computational complexity is polynomial in the block
length; making GLRT-optimal noncoherent detection feasible for implementation.
We also provide even lower complexity suboptimal algorithms. Simulations show
that the suboptimal algorithms have performance indistinguishable from the
optimal algorithms. Finally, we consider block based transmission, and propose
to use noncoherent detection as an alternative to pilot assisted transmission
(PAT). The new technique is shown to outperform PAT.

On restrictions of balanced 2-interval graphs

The class of 2-interval graphs has been introduced for modelling scheduling

Some of those applications imply restrictions on the 2-interval graphs, and
justify the introduction of a hierarchy of subclasses of 2-interval graphs that
generalize line graphs: balanced 2-interval graphs, unit 2-interval graphs, and
(x,x)-interval graphs. We provide instances that show that all the inclusions
are strict. We extend the NP-completeness proof of recognizing 2-interval
graphs to the recognition of balanced 2-interval graphs. Finally we give hints
on the complexity of unit 2-interval graphs recognition, by studying
relationships with other graph classes: proper circular-arc, quasi-line graphs,
K_{1,5}-free graphs, ...

Exploiting Social Annotation for Automatic Resource Discovery
2007-04-12

Plangprasopchok,Anon
Lerman,Kristina

Information integration applications, such as mediators or mashups, that
require access to information resources currently rely on users manually
discovering and integrating them in the application. Manual resource discovery
is a slow process, requiring the user to sift through results obtained via
keyword-based search. Although search methods have advanced to include evidence
from document contents, its metadata and the contents and link structure of the
referring pages, they still do not adequately cover information sources --
often called ``the hidden Web''-- that dynamically generate documents in
response to a query. The recently popular social bookmarking sites, which allow
users to annotate and share metadata about various information sources, provide
rich evidence for resource discovery. In this paper, we describe a
probabilistic model of the user annotation process in a social bookmarking
system del.icio.us. We then use the model to automatically find resources
relevant to a particular information domain. Our experimental results on data
obtained from \emph{del.icio.us} show this approach as a promising method for
helping automate the resource discovery task.

Personalizing Image Search Results on Flickr
2007-04-12

Lerman,Kristina
Plangprasopchok,Anon
Wong,Chio

The social media site Flickr allows users to upload their photos, annotate
them with tags, submit them to groups, and also to form social networks by
adding other users as contacts. Flickr offers multiple ways of browsing or
searching it. One option is tag search, which returns all images tagged with a
specific keyword. If the keyword is ambiguous, e.g., ``beetle'' could mean an
insect or a car, tag search results will include many images that are not
relevant to the sense the user had in mind when executing the query. We claim
that users express their photography interests through the metadata they add in
the form of contacts and image annotations. We show how to exploit this
metadata to personalize search results for the user, thereby improving search
performance. First, we show that we can significantly improve search precision
by filtering tag search results by user's contacts or a larger social network
that includes those contact's contacts. Secondly, we describe a probabilistic
model that takes advantage of tag information to discover latent topics
contained in the search results. The users' interests can similarly be
described by the tags they used for annotating their images. The latent topics
found by the model are then used to personalize search results by finding
images on topics that are of interest to the user.

Settling the Complexity of Computing Two-Player Nash Equilibria
2007-04-12

Chen,Xi
Deng,Xiaotie
Teng,Shang-Hua

We settle a long-standing open question in algorithmic game theory. We prove
that Bimatrix, the problem of finding a Nash equilibrium in a two-player game,
is complete for the complexity class PPAD Polynomial Parity Argument, Directed
version) introduced by Papadimitriou in 1991.
  This is the first of a series of results concerning the complexity of Nash
equilibria. In particular, we prove the following theorems:
  Bimatrix does not have a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme unless
every problem in PPAD is solvable in polynomial time. The smoothed complexity
of the classic Lemke-Howson algorithm and, in fact, of any algorithm for
Bimatrix is not polynomial unless every problem in PPAD is solvable in
randomized polynomial time. Our results demonstrate that, even in the simplest
form of non-cooperative games, equilibrium computation and approximation are
polynomial-time equivalent to fixed point computation. Our results also have
two broad complexity implications in mathematical economics and operations
research: Arrow-Debreu market equilibria are PPAD-hard to compute. The P-Matrix
Linear Complementary Problem is computationally harder than convex programming
unless every problem in PPAD is solvable in polynomial time.

Locally Decodable Codes From Nice Subsets of Finite Fields and Prime Factors of Mersenne Numbers
2007-04-13

Kedlaya,Kiran S.
Yekhanin,Sergey

A k-query Locally Decodable Code (LDC) encodes an n-bit message x as an N-bit
codeword C(x), such that one can probabilistically recover any bit x_i of the
message by querying only k bits of the codeword C(x), even after some constant
fraction of codeword bits has been corrupted. The major goal of LDC related
research is to establish the optimal trade-off between length and query
complexity of such codes.
  Recently [Y] introduced a novel technique for constructing locally decodable
codes and vastly improved the upper bounds for code length. The technique is
based on Mersenne primes. In this paper we extend the work of [Y] and argue
that further progress via these methods is tied to progress on an old number
theory question regarding the size of the largest prime factors of Mersenne
numbers.
  Specifically, we show that every Mersenne number m=2^t-1 that has a prime
factor p>m^\gamma yields a family of k(\gamma)-query locally decodable codes of
length Exp(n^{1/t}). Conversely, if for some fixed k and all \epsilon > 0 one
can use the technique of [Y] to obtain a family of k-query LDCs of length
Exp(n^\epsilon); then infinitely many Mersenne numbers have prime factors arger
than known currently.

A Cut-free Sequent Calculus for Bi-Intuitionistic Logic: Extended Version
2007-04-13
2007-04-16
Buisman,Linda
Goré,Rajeev

Bi-intuitionistic logic is the extension of intuitionistic logic with a
connective dual to implication. Bi-intuitionistic logic was introduced by
Rauszer as a Hilbert calculus with algebraic and Kripke semantics. But her
subsequent ``cut-free'' sequent calculus for BiInt has recently been shown by
Uustalu to fail cut-elimination. We present a new cut-free sequent calculus for
BiInt, and prove it sound and complete with respect to its Kripke semantics.
Ensuring completeness is complicated by the interaction between implication and
its dual, similarly to future and past modalities in tense logic. Our calculus
handles this interaction using extended sequents which pass information from
premises to conclusions using variables instantiated at the leaves of failed
derivation trees. Our simple termination argument allows our calculus to be
used for automated deduction, although this is not its main purpose.

Self-Organization applied to Dynamic Network Layout
2007-04-13
2009-01-20
Geipel,Markus M.

As networks and their structure have become a major field of research, a
strong demand for network visualization has emerged. We address this challenge
by formalizing the well established spring layout in terms of dynamic
equations. We thus open up the design space for new algorithms. Drawing from
the knowledge of systems design, we derive a layout algorithm that remedies
several drawbacks of the original spring layout. This new algorithm relies on
the balancing of two antagonistic forces. We thus call it {\em arf} for
"attractive and repulsive forces". It is, as we claim, particularly suited for
a dynamic layout of smaller networks ($n < 10^3$). We back this claim with
several application examples from on going complex systems research.

Information Theoretic Proofs of Entropy Power Inequalities
2007-04-13
2010-08-24
Rioul,Olivier

While most useful information theoretic inequalities can be deduced from the
basic properties of entropy or mutual information, up to now Shannon's entropy
power inequality (EPI) is an exception: Existing information theoretic proofs
of the EPI hinge on representations of differential entropy using either Fisher
information or minimum mean-square error (MMSE), which are derived from de
Bruijn's identity. In this paper, we first present an unified view of these
proofs, showing that they share two essential ingredients: 1) a data processing
argument applied to a covariance-preserving linear transformation; 2) an
integration over a path of a continuous Gaussian perturbation. Using these
ingredients, we develop a new and brief proof of the EPI through a mutual
information inequality, which replaces Stam and Blachman's Fisher information
inequality (FII) and an inequality for MMSE by Guo, Shamai and Verd\'u used in
earlier proofs. The result has the advantage of being very simple in that it
relies only on the basic properties of mutual information. These ideas are then
generalized to various extended versions of the EPI: Zamir and Feder's
generalized EPI for linear transformations of the random variables, Takano and
Johnson's EPI for dependent variables, Liu and Viswanath's
covariance-constrained EPI, and Costa's concavity inequality for the entropy
power.

Assessment and Propagation of Input Uncertainty in Tree-based Option Pricing Models
2007-04-13

Gzyl,Henryk
Molina,German
ter Horst,Enrique

This paper aims to provide a practical example on the assessment and
propagation of input uncertainty for option pricing when using tree-based
methods. Input uncertainty is propagated into output uncertainty, reflecting
that option prices are as unknown as the inputs they are based on. Option
pricing formulas are tools whose validity is conditional not only on how close
the model represents reality, but also on the quality of the inputs they use,
and those inputs are usually not observable. We provide three alternative
frameworks to calibrate option pricing tree models, propagating parameter
uncertainty into the resulting option prices. We finally compare our methods
with classical calibration-based results assuming that there is no options
market established. These methods can be applied to pricing of instruments for
which there is not an options market, as well as a methodological tool to
account for parameter and model uncertainty in theoretical option pricing.

Unicast and Multicast Qos Routing with Soft Constraint Logic Programming
2007-04-13
2008-04-21
Bistarelli,Stefano
Montanari,Ugo
Rossi,Francesca
Santini,Francesco

We present a formal model to represent and solve the unicast/multicast
routing problem in networks with Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. To
attain this, first we translate the network adapting it to a weighted graph
(unicast) or and-or graph (multicast), where the weight on a connector
corresponds to the multidimensional cost of sending a packet on the related
network link: each component of the weights vector represents a different QoS
metric value (e.g. bandwidth, cost, delay, packet loss). The second step
consists in writing this graph as a program in Soft Constraint Logic
Programming (SCLP): the engine of this framework is then able to find the best
paths/trees by optimizing their costs and solving the constraints imposed on
them (e.g. delay < 40msec), thus finding a solution to QoS routing problems.
Moreover, c-semiring structures are a convenient tool to model QoS metrics. At
last, we provide an implementation of the framework over scale-free networks
and we suggest how the performance can be improved.

Low-density graph codes that are optimal for source/channel coding and binning
2007-04-13

Wainwright,Martin J.
Martinian,Emin

We describe and analyze the joint source/channel coding properties of a class
of sparse graphical codes based on compounding a low-density generator matrix
(LDGM) code with a low-density parity check (LDPC) code. Our first pair of
theorems establish that there exist codes from this ensemble, with all degrees
remaining bounded independently of block length, that are simultaneously
optimal as both source and channel codes when encoding and decoding are
performed optimally. More precisely, in the context of lossy compression, we
prove that finite degree constructions can achieve any pair $(R, D)$ on the
rate-distortion curve of the binary symmetric source. In the context of channel
coding, we prove that finite degree codes can achieve any pair $(C, p)$ on the
capacity-noise curve of the binary symmetric channel. Next, we show that our
compound construction has a nested structure that can be exploited to achieve
the Wyner-Ziv bound for source coding with side information (SCSI), as well as
the Gelfand-Pinsker bound for channel coding with side information (CCSI).
Although the current results are based on optimal encoding and decoding, the
proposed graphical codes have sparse structure and high girth that renders them
well-suited to message-passing and other efficient decoding procedures.

Transaction-Oriented Simulation In Ad Hoc Grids
2007-04-06

Krafft,Gerald

This paper analyses the possibilities of performing parallel
transaction-oriented simulations with a special focus on the space-parallel
approach and discrete event simulation synchronisation algorithms that are
suitable for transaction-oriented simulation and the target environment of Ad
Hoc Grids. To demonstrate the findings a Java-based parallel
transaction-oriented simulator for the simulation language GPSS/H is
implemented on the basis of the promising Shock Resistant Time Warp
synchronisation algorithm and using the Grid framework ProActive. The
validation of this parallel simulator shows that the Shock Resistant Time Warp
algorithm can successfully reduce the number of rolled back Transaction moves
but it also reveals circumstances in which the Shock Resistant Time Warp
algorithm can be outperformed by the normal Time Warp algorithm. The conclusion
of this paper suggests possible improvements to the Shock Resistant Time Warp
algorithm to avoid such problems.

On-line Chain Partitions of Up-growing Semi-orders

On-line chain partition is a two-player game between Spoiler and Algorithm.
Spoiler presents a partially ordered set, point by point. Algorithm assigns
incoming points (immediately and irrevocably) to the chains which constitute a
chain partition of the order. The value of the game for orders of width $w$ is
a minimum number $\fVal(w)$ such that Algorithm has a strategy using at most
$\fVal(w)$ chains on orders of width at most $w$. We analyze the chain
partition game for up-growing semi-orders. Surprisingly, the golden ratio comes
into play and the value of the game is $\lfloor\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}\; w
\rfloor$.

Analysis of the 802.11e Enhanced Distributed Channel Access Function
2007-04-13

Inan,Inanc
Keceli,Feyza
Ayanoglu,Ender

The IEEE 802.11e standard revises the Medium Access Control (MAC) layer of
the former IEEE 802.11 standard for Quality-of-Service (QoS) provision in the
Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs). The Enhanced Distributed Channel Access
(EDCA) function of 802.11e defines multiple Access Categories (AC) with
AC-specific Contention Window (CW) sizes, Arbitration Interframe Space (AIFS)
values, and Transmit Opportunity (TXOP) limits to support MAC-level QoS and
prioritization. We propose an analytical model for the EDCA function which
incorporates an accurate CW, AIFS, and TXOP differentiation at any traffic
load. The proposed model is also shown to capture the effect of MAC layer
buffer size on the performance. Analytical and simulation results are compared
to demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed approach for varying traffic loads,
EDCA parameters, and MAC layer buffer space.

The recently ratified IEEE 802.11e standard defines the Enhanced Distributed
Channel Access (EDCA) function for Quality-of-Service (QoS) provisioning in the
Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs). The EDCA uses Carrier Sense Multiple
Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA) and slotted Binary Exponential
Backoff (BEB) mechanism. We present a simple mathematical analysis framework
for the EDCA function. Our analysis considers the fact that the distributed
random access systems exhibit cyclic behavior where each station successfully
transmits a packet in a cycle. Our analysis shows that an AC-specific cycle
time exists for the EDCA function. Validating the theoretical results via
simulations, we show that the proposed analysis accurately captures EDCA
saturation performance in terms of average throughput, medium access delay, and
packet loss ratio. The cycle time analysis is a simple and insightful
substitute for previously proposed more complex EDCA models.

Most of the deployed IEEE 802.11e Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs) use
infrastructure Basic Service Set (BSS) in which an Access Point (AP) serves as
a gateway between wired and wireless domains. We present the unfairness problem
between the uplink and the downlink flows of any Access Category (AC) in the
802.11e Enhanced Distributed Channel Access (EDCA) when the default settings of
the EDCA parameters are used. We propose a simple analytical model to calculate
the EDCA parameter settings that achieve weighted fair resource allocation for
all uplink and downlink flows. We also propose a simple model-assisted
measurement-based dynamic EDCA parameter adaptation algorithm. Moreover, our
dynamic solution addresses the differences in the transport layer and the
Medium Access Control (MAC) layer interactions of User Datagram Protocol (UDP)
and Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). We show that proposed Contention
Window (CW) and Transmit Opportunity (TXOP) limit adaptation at the AP provides
fair UDP and TCP access between uplink and downlink flows of the same AC while
preserving prioritization among ACs.

region reduces to Han and Kobayashi achievable region for interference
channels, the capacity region for degraded relay channels, and the capacity
region for the Gaussian vector broadcast channel. Numerical examples for the

An algebraic generalization of Kripke structures
2007-04-14

Marcelino,Sérgio
Resende,Pedro

The Kripke semantics of classical propositional normal modal logic is made
algebraic via an embedding of Kripke structures into the larger class of
pointed stably supported quantales. This algebraic semantics subsumes the
traditional algebraic semantics based on lattices with unary operators, and it
suggests natural interpretations of modal logic, of possible interest in the
applications, in structures that arise in geometry and analysis, such as
foliated manifolds and operator algebras, via topological groupoids and inverse
semigroups. We study completeness properties of the quantale based semantics
for the systems K, T, K4, S4, and S5, in particular obtaining an axiomatization
for S5 which does not use negation or the modal necessity operator. As
additional examples we describe intuitionistic propositional modal logic, the
logic of programs PDL, and the ramified temporal logic CTL.

Blind Identification of Distributed Antenna Systems with Multiple Carrier Frequency Offsets
2007-04-15

Yu,Yuanning
Petropulu,Athina P.
Poor,H. Vincent

In spatially distributed multiuser antenna systems, the received signal
contains multiple carrier-frequency offsets (CFOs) arising from mismatch
between the oscillators of transmitters and receivers. This results in a
time-varying rotation of the data constellation, which needs to be compensated
at the receiver before symbol recovery. In this paper, a new approach for blind
CFO estimation and symbol recovery is proposed. The received base-band signal
is over-sampled, and its polyphase components are used to formulate a virtual
Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) problem. By applying blind MIMO system
estimation techniques, the system response can be estimated and decoupled
versions of the user symbols can be recovered, each one of which contains a
distinct CFO. By applying a decision feedback Phase Lock Loop (PLL), the CFO
can be mitigated and the transmitted symbols can be recovered. The estimated
MIMO system response provides information about the CFOs that can be used to
initialize the PLL, speed up its convergence, and avoid ambiguities usually
linked with PLL.

A study of structural properties on profiles HMMs
2007-04-16
2008-12-11
Bernardes,Juliana S
Davila,Alberto
Costa,Vitor Santos
Zaverucha,Gerson

Motivation: Profile hidden Markov Models (pHMMs) are a popular and very
useful tool in the detection of the remote homologue protein families.
Unfortunately, their performance is not always satisfactory when proteins are
in the 'twilight zone'. We present HMMER-STRUCT, a model construction algorithm
and tool that tries to improve pHMM performance by using structural information
while training pHMMs. As a first step, HMMER-STRUCT constructs a set of pHMMs.
Each pHMM is constructed by weighting each residue in an aligned protein
according to a specific structural property of the residue. Properties used
were primary, secondary and tertiary structures, accessibility and packing.
HMMER-STRUCT then prioritizes the results by voting. Results: We used the SCOP
database to perform our experiments. Throughout, we apply leave-one-family-out
cross-validation over protein superfamilies. First, we used the MAMMOTH-mult
structural aligner to align the training set proteins. Then, we performed two
sets of experiments. In a first experiment, we compared structure weighted
models against standard pHMMs and against each other. In a second experiment,
we compared the voting model against individual pHMMs. We compare method
performance through ROC curves and through Precision/Recall curves, and assess
significance through the paired two tailed t-test. Our results show significant
performance improvements of all structurally weighted models over default
HMMER, and a significant improvement in sensitivity of the combined models over
both the original model and the structurally weighted models.

Extensive Games with Possibly Unaware Players
2007-04-16

Halpern,Joseph Y.
Rêgo,Leandro C.

Standard game theory assumes that the structure of the game is common
knowledge among players. We relax this assumption by considering extensive
games where agents may be unaware of the complete structure of the game. In
particular, they may not be aware of moves that they and other agents can make.
We show how such games can be represented; the key idea is to describe the game
from the point of view of every agent at every node of the game tree. We
provide a generalization of Nash equilibrium and show that every game with
awareness has a generalized Nash equilibrium. Finally, we extend these results
to games with awareness of unawareness, where a player i may be aware that a
player j can make moves that i is not aware of, and to subjective games, where
payers may have no common knowledge regarding the actual game and their beliefs
are incompatible with a common prior.

This paper studies the performance of partial-Rake (PRake) receivers in
impulse-radio ultrawideband wireless networks when an energy-efficient power
control scheme is adopted. Due to the large bandwidth of the system, the
multipath channel is assumed to be frequency-selective. By using noncooperative
game-theoretic models and large system analysis, explicit expressions are
derived in terms of network parameters to measure the effects of self- and
multiple-access interference at a receiving access point. Performance of the
PRake is compared in terms of achieved utilities and loss to that of the
all-Rake receiver.

A Note on the Inapproximability of Correlation Clustering
2007-04-16
2009-03-22
Tan,Jinsong

We consider inapproximability of the correlation clustering problem defined
as follows: Given a graph $G = (V,E)$ where each edge is labeled either "+"
(similar) or "-" (dissimilar), correlation clustering seeks to partition the
vertices into clusters so that the number of pairs correctly (resp.
incorrectly) classified with respect to the labels is maximized (resp.
minimized). The two complementary problems are called MaxAgree and MinDisagree,
respectively, and have been studied on complete graphs, where every edge is
labeled, and general graphs, where some edge might not have been labeled.
Natural edge-weighted versions of both problems have been studied as well. Let
S-MaxAgree denote the weighted problem where all weights are taken from set S,
we show that S-MaxAgree with weights bounded by $O(|V|^{1/2-\delta})$
essentially belongs to the same hardness class in the following sense: if there
is a polynomial time algorithm that approximates S-MaxAgree within a factor of
$\lambda = O(\log{|V|})$ with high probability, then for any choice of S',
S'-MaxAgree can be approximated in polynomial time within a factor of $(\lambda
+ \epsilon)$, where $\epsilon > 0$ can be arbitrarily small, with high
probability. A similar statement also holds for $S-MinDisagree. This result
implies it is hard (assuming $NP \neq RP$) to approximate unweighted MaxAgree
within a factor of $80/79-\epsilon$, improving upon a previous known factor of
$116/115-\epsilon$ by Charikar et. al. \cite{Chari05}.

The Wiretap Channel with Feedback: Encryption over the Channel
2007-04-17

Lai,Lifeng
Gamal,Hesham El
Poor,H. Vincent

In this work, the critical role of noisy feedback in enhancing the secrecy
capacity of the wiretap channel is established. Unlike previous works, where a
noiseless public discussion channel is used for feedback, the feed-forward and
feedback signals share the same noisy channel in the present model. Quite
interestingly, this noisy feedback model is shown to be more advantageous in
the current setting. More specifically, the discrete memoryless modulo-additive
channel with a full-duplex destination node is considered first, and it is
shown that the judicious use of feedback increases the perfect secrecy capacity
to the capacity of the source-destination channel in the absence of the
wiretapper. In the achievability scheme, the feedback signal corresponds to a
private key, known only to the destination. In the half-duplex scheme, a novel
feedback technique that always achieves a positive perfect secrecy rate (even
when the source-wiretapper channel is less noisy than the source-destination
channel) is proposed. These results hinge on the modulo-additive property of
the channel, which is exploited by the destination to perform encryption over
the channel without revealing its key to the source. Finally, this scheme is
extended to the continuous real valued modulo-$\Lambda$ channel where it is
shown that the perfect secrecy capacity with feedback is also equal to the
capacity in the absence of the wiretapper.

Kekul\'e Cells for Molecular Computation

van der Veen,M. H.

The configurations of single and double bonds in polycyclic hydrocarbons are
abstracted as Kekul\'e states of graphs. Sending a so-called soliton over an
open channel between ports (external nodes) of the graph changes the Kekul\'e
state and therewith the set of open channels in the graph. This switching
behaviour is proposed as a basis for molecular computation. The proposal is
highly speculative but may have tremendous impact.
  Kekul\'e states with the same boundary behaviour (port assignment) can be
regarded as equivalent. This gives rise to the abstraction of Kekul\'e cells.
The basic theory of Kekul\'e states and Kekul\'e cells is developed here, up to
the classification of Kekul\'e cells with $\leq 4$ ports. To put the theory in
context, we generalize Kekul\'e states to semi-Kekul\'e states, which form the
solutions of a linear system of equations over the field of the bits 0 and 1.
We briefly study so-called omniconjugated graphs, in which every port
assignment of the right signature has a Kekul\'e state. Omniconjugated graphs
may be useful as connectors between computational elements. We finally
investigate some examples with potentially useful switching behaviour.

Using Image Attributes for Human Identification Protocols
2007-04-18

Jameel,Hassan
Lee,Heejo
Lee,Sungyoung

A secure human identification protocol aims at authenticating human users to
a remote server when even the users' inputs are not hidden from an adversary.
Recently, the authors proposed a human identification protocol in the RSA
Conference 2007, which is loosely based on the ability of humans to efficiently
process an image. The advantage being that an automated adversary is not
effective in attacking the protocol without human assistance. This paper
extends that work by trying to solve some of the open problems. First, we
analyze the complexity of defeating the proposed protocols by quantifying the
workload of a human adversary. Secondly, we propose a new construction based on
textual CAPTCHAs (Reverse Turing Tests) in order to make the generation of
automated challenges easier. We also present a brief experiment involving real
human users to find out the number of possible attributes in a given image and
give some guidelines for the selection of challenge questions based on the
results. Finally, we analyze the previously proposed protocol in detail for the
relationship between the secrets. Our results show that we can construct human
identification protocols based on image evaluation with reasonably
``quantified'' security guarantees based on our model.

on a CRAY C98. Analysis of the computation efficiency is performed using simple
problems. The electromagnetic scattering of a plane wave by a perfect electric
conducting airplane is finally given as example.

Dumas,Jean-Guillaume

Urbanska,Anna

This paper deals with the computation of the rank and of some integer Smith
forms of a series of sparse matrices arising in algebraic K-theory. The number
of non zero entries in the considered matrices ranges from 8 to 37 millions.
The largest rank computation took more than 35 days on 50 processors. We report
on the actual algorithms we used to build the matrices, their link to the
motivic cohomology and the linear algebra and parallelizations required to
perform such huge computations. In particular, these results are part of the
first computation of the cohomology of the linear group GL_7(Z).

Scaling Laws of Cognitive Networks

Vu,Mai
Devroye,Natasha
Sharif,Masoud
Tarokh,Vahid

We consider a cognitive network consisting of n random pairs of cognitive
transmitters and receivers communicating simultaneously in the presence of
multiple primary users. Of interest is how the maximum throughput achieved by
the cognitive users scales with n. Furthermore, how far these users must be
from a primary user to guarantee a given primary outage. Two scenarios are
considered for the network scaling law: (i) when each cognitive transmitter
uses constant power to communicate with a cognitive receiver at a bounded
distance away, and (ii) when each cognitive transmitter scales its power
according to the distance to a considered primary user, allowing the cognitive
transmitter-receiver distances to grow. Using single-hop transmission, suitable
for cognitive devices of opportunistic nature, we show that, in both scenarios,
with path loss larger than 2, the cognitive network throughput scales linearly
with the number of cognitive users. We then explore the radius of a primary
exclusive region void of cognitive transmitters. We obtain bounds on this
radius for a given primary outage constraint. These bounds can help in the
design of a primary network with exclusive regions, outside of which cognitive
users may transmit freely. Our results show that opportunistic secondary
spectrum access using single-hop transmission is promising.

A Nice Labelling for Tree-Like Event Structures of Degree 3
2007-04-18

Santocanale,Luigi

We address the problem of &#64257;nding nice labellings for event structures
of degree 3. We develop a minimum theory by which we prove that the labelling
number of an event structure of degree 3 is bounded by a linear function of the
height. The main theorem we present in this paper states that event structures
of degree 3 whose causality order is a tree have a nice labelling with 3
colors. Finally, we exemplify how to use this theorem to construct upper bounds
for the labelling number of other event structures of degree 3.

Power control algorithms for CDMA networks based on large system analysis
2007-04-18

Buzzi,Stefano
Poor,H. Vincent

Power control is a fundamental task accomplished in any wireless cellular
network; its aim is to set the transmit power of any mobile terminal, so that
each user is able to achieve its own target SINR. While conventional power
control algorithms require knowledge of a number of parameters of the signal of
interest and of the multiaccess interference, in this paper it is shown that in
a large CDMA system much of this information can be dispensed with, and
effective distributed power control algorithms may be implemented with very
little information on the user of interest. An uplink CDMA system subject to
flat fading is considered with a focus on the cases in which a linear MMSE
receiver and a non-linear MMSE serial interference cancellation receiver are
adopted; for the latter case new formulas are also given for the system SINR in
the large system asymptote. Experimental results show an excellent agreement
between the performance and the power profile of the proposed distributed
algorithms and that of conventional ones that require much greater prior
knowledge.

Power control and receiver design for energy efficiency in multipath CDMA channels with bandlimited waveforms
2007-04-18

Buzzi,Stefano
Massaro,Valeria
Poor,H. Vincent

This paper is focused on the cross-layer design problem of joint multiuser
detection and power control for energy-efficiency optimization in a wireless
data network through a game-theoretic approach. Building on work of Meshkati,
et al., wherein the tools of game-theory are used in order to achieve
energy-efficiency in a simple synchronous code division multiple access system,
system asynchronism, the use of bandlimited chip-pulses, and the multipath
distortion induced by the wireless channel are explicitly incorporated into the
analysis. Several non-cooperative games are proposed wherein users may vary
their transmit power and their uplink receiver in order to maximize their
utility, which is defined here as the ratio of data throughput to transmit
power. In particular, the case in which a linear multiuser detector is adopted
at the receiver is considered first, and then, the more challenging case in
which non-linear decision feedback multiuser detectors are employed is
considered. The proposed games are shown to admit a unique Nash equilibrium
point, while simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed
solutions, as well as that the use of a decision-feedback multiuser receiver
brings remarkable performance improvements.

Bounded Pushdown dimension vs Lempel Ziv information density
2007-04-18

Albert,Pilar
Mayordomo,Elvira
Moser,Philippe

In this paper we introduce a variant of pushdown dimension called bounded
pushdown (BPD) dimension, that measures the density of information contained in
a sequence, relative to a BPD automata, i.e. a finite state machine equipped
with an extra infinite memory stack, with the additional requirement that every
input symbol only allows a bounded number of stack movements. BPD automata are
a natural real-time restriction of pushdown automata. We show that BPD
dimension is a robust notion by giving an equivalent characterization of BPD
dimension in terms of BPD compressors. We then study the relationships between
BPD compression, and the standard Lempel-Ziv (LZ) compression algorithm, and
show that in contrast to the finite-state compressor case, LZ is not universal
for bounded pushdown compressors in a strong sense: we construct a sequence
that LZ fails to compress signicantly, but that is compressed by at least a
factor 2 by a BPD compressor. As a corollary we obtain a strong separation
between finite-state and BPD dimension.

Light Logics and Optimal Reduction: Completeness and Complexity
2007-04-18

Baillot,Patrick
Coppola,Paolo
Lago,Ugo Dal

Typing of lambda-terms in Elementary and Light Affine Logic (EAL, LAL, resp.)
has been studied for two different reasons: on the one hand the evaluation of
typed terms using LAL (EAL, resp.) proof-nets admits a guaranteed polynomial
(elementary, resp.) bound; on the other hand these terms can also be evaluated
by optimal reduction using the abstract version of Lamping's algorithm. The
first reduction is global while the second one is local and asynchronous. We
prove that for LAL (EAL, resp.) typed terms, Lamping's abstract algorithm also
admits a polynomial (elementary, resp.) bound. We also show its soundness and
completeness (for EAL and LAL with type fixpoints), by using a simple geometry
of interaction model (context semantics).

Optimum Linear LLR Calculation for Iterative Decoding on Fading Channels
2007-04-18

Yazdani,Raman
Ardakani,Masoud

On a fading channel with no channel state information at the receiver,
calculating true log-likelihood ratios (LLR) is complicated. Existing work
assume that the power of the additive noise is known and use the expected value
of the fading gain in a linear function of the channel output to find
approximate LLRs. In this work, we first assume that the power of the additive
noise is known and we find the optimum linear approximation of LLRs in the
sense of maximum achievable transmission rate on the channel. The maximum
achievable rate under this linear LLR calculation is almost equal to the
maximum achievable rate under true LLR calculation. We also observe that this
method appears to be the optimum in the sense of bit error rate performance
too. These results are then extended to the case that the noise power is
unknown at the receiver and a performance almost identical to the case that the
noise power is perfectly known is obtained.

Physical Layer Network Coding
2007-04-19

Shengli,Zhang
Liew,Soung-Chang
Lam,Patrick P. K.

A main distinguishing feature of a wireless network compared with a wired
network is its broadcast nature, in which the signal transmitted by a node may
reach several other nodes, and a node may receive signals from several other
nodes simultaneously. Rather than a blessing, this feature is treated more as
an interference-inducing nuisance in most wireless networks today (e.g., IEEE
802.11). This paper shows that the concept of network coding can be applied at
the physical layer to turn the broadcast property into a capacity-boosting
advantage in wireless ad hoc networks. Specifically, we propose a
physical-layer network coding (PNC) scheme to coordinate transmissions among
nodes. In contrast to straightforward network coding which performs coding
arithmetic on digital bit streams after they have been received, PNC makes use
of the additive nature of simultaneously arriving electromagnetic (EM) waves
for equivalent coding operation. And in doing so, PNC can potentially achieve
100% and 50% throughput increases compared with traditional transmission and
straightforward network coding, respectively, in multi-hop networks. More
specifically, the information-theoretic capacity of PNC is almost double that
of traditional transmission in the SNR region of practical interest (higher
than 0dB). We believe this is a first paper that ventures into EM-wave-based
network coding at the physical layer and demonstrates its potential for
boosting network capacity.

Algebraic Distributed Space-Time Codes with Low ML Decoding Complexity
2007-04-19

Rajan,G. Susinder

"Extended Clifford algebras" are introduced as a means to obtain low ML
decoding complexity space-time block codes. Using left regular matrix
representations of two specific classes of extended Clifford algebras, two
systematic algebraic constructions of full diversity Distributed Space-Time
Codes (DSTCs) are provided for any power of two number of relays. The left
regular matrix representation has been shown to naturally result in space-time
codes meeting the additional constraints required for DSTCs. The DSTCs so
constructed have the salient feature of reduced Maximum Likelihood (ML)
decoding complexity. In particular, the ML decoding of these codes can be
performed by applying the lattice decoder algorithm on a lattice of four times
lesser dimension than what is required in general. Moreover these codes have a
uniform distribution of power among the relays and in time, thus leading to a
low Peak to Average Power Ratio at the relays.

STBCs from Representation of Extended Clifford Algebras
2007-04-19

Rajan,G. Susinder
Rajan,B. Sundar

A set of sufficient conditions to construct $\lambda$-real symbol Maximum
Likelihood (ML) decodable STBCs have recently been provided by Karmakar et al.
STBCs satisfying these sufficient conditions were named as Clifford Unitary
Weight (CUW) codes. In this paper, the maximal rate (as measured in complex
symbols per channel use) of CUW codes for $\lambda=2^a,a\in\mathbb{N}$ is
obtained using tools from representation theory. Two algebraic constructions of
codes achieving this maximal rate are also provided. One of the constructions
is obtained using linear representation of finite groups whereas the other
construction is based on the concept of right module algebra over
non-commutative rings. To the knowledge of the authors, this is the first paper
in which matrices over non-commutative rings is used to construct STBCs. An
algebraic explanation is provided for the 'ABBA' construction first proposed by
Tirkkonen et al and the tensor product construction proposed by Karmakar et al.
Furthermore, it is established that the 4 transmit antenna STBC originally
proposed by Tirkkonen et al based on the ABBA construction is actually a single
complex symbol ML decodable code if the design variables are permuted and
signal sets of appropriate dimensions are chosen.

First, the notion of $g$-group encodable and $g$-group decodable linear STBCs
is introduced. Then for a known class of rate-1 linear designs, an explicit
construction of fully-diverse signal sets that lead to four-group encodable and
four-group decodable differential scaled unitary STBCs for any power of two
number of antennas is provided. Previous works on differential STBCs either
sacrifice decoding complexity for higher rate or sacrifice rate for lower
decoding complexity.

full diversity, four-group encodable and four-group decodable Differential
Space-Time Codes (DSTCs) is proposed for use as Distributed DSTCs (DDSTCs) in
the proposed set up. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first known low

The Extended BP (EBP) Generalized EXIT (GEXIT) function introduced in
\cite{MMRU05} plays a fundamental role in the asymptotic analysis of sparse
graph codes. For transmission over the binary erasure channel (BEC) the
analytic properties of the EBP GEXIT function are relatively simple and well
understood. The general case is much harder and even the existence of the curve
is not known in general. We introduce some tools from non-linear analysis which
can be useful to prove the existence of EXIT like curves in some cases. The
main tool is the Krasnoselskii-Rabinowitz (KR) bifurcation theorem.

Joint universal lossy coding and identification of stationary mixing sources

The problem of joint universal source coding and modeling, treated in the
context of lossless codes by Rissanen, was recently generalized to fixed-rate
lossy coding of finitely parametrized continuous-alphabet i.i.d. sources. We
extend these results to variable-rate lossy block coding of stationary ergodic
sources and show that, for bounded metric distortion measures, any finitely
parametrized family of stationary sources satisfying suitable mixing,
smoothness and Vapnik-Chervonenkis learnability conditions admits universal
schemes for joint lossy source coding and identification. We also give several
explicit examples of parametric sources satisfying the regularity conditions.

Opportunistic Communications in an Orthogonal Multiaccess Relay Channel
2007-04-20

Sankar,Lalitha
Liang,Yingbin
Poor,H. Vincent
Mandayam,Narayan B.

The problem of resource allocation is studied for a two-user fading
orthogonal multiaccess relay channel (MARC) where both users (sources)
communicate with a destination in the presence of a relay. A half-duplex relay
is considered that transmits on a channel orthogonal to that used by the
sources. The instantaneous fading state between every transmit-receive pair in
this network is assumed to be known at both the transmitter and receiver. Under
an average power constraint at each source and the relay, the sum-rate for the
achievable strategy of decode-and-forward (DF) is maximized over all power
allocations (policies) at the sources and relay. It is shown that the sum-rate
maximizing policy exploits the multiuser fading diversity to reveal the
optimality of opportunistic channel use by each user. A geometric
interpretation of the optimal power policy is also presented.

Minimum Expected Distortion in Gaussian Layered Broadcast Coding with Successive Refinement

2007-04-23
Ng,Chris T. K.
Gunduz,Deniz
Goldsmith,Andrea J.
Erkip,Elza

A transmitter without channel state information (CSI) wishes to send a
delay-limited Gaussian source over a slowly fading channel. The source is coded
in superimposed layers, with each layer successively refining the description
in the previous one. The receiver decodes the layers that are supported by the
channel realization and reconstructs the source up to a distortion. In the
limit of a continuum of infinite layers, the optimal power distribution that
minimizes the expected distortion is given by the solution to a set of linear
differential equations in terms of the density of the fading distribution. In
the optimal power distribution, as SNR increases, the allocation over the
higher layers remains unchanged; rather the extra power is allocated towards
the lower layers. On the other hand, as the bandwidth ratio b (channel uses per
source symbol) tends to zero, the power distribution that minimizes expected
distortion converges to the power distribution that maximizes expected
capacity. While expected distortion can be improved by acquiring CSI at the
transmitter (CSIT) or by increasing diversity from the realization of
independent fading paths, at high SNR the performance benefit from diversity
exceeds that from CSIT, especially when b is large.

Exploiting Heavy Tails in Training Times of Multilayer Perceptrons: A Case Study with the UCI Thyroid Disease Database

Cantador,Ivan

The random initialization of weights of a multilayer perceptron makes it
possible to model its training process as a Las Vegas algorithm, i.e. a
randomized algorithm which stops when some required training error is obtained,
and whose execution time is a random variable. This modeling is used to perform
a case study on a well-known pattern recognition benchmark: the UCI Thyroid
Disease Database. Empirical evidence is presented of the training time
probability distribution exhibiting a heavy tail behavior, meaning a big
probability mass of long executions. This fact is exploited to reduce the
training time cost by applying two simple restart strategies. The first assumes
full knowledge of the distribution yielding a 40% cut down in expected time
with respect to the training without restarts. The second, assumes null
knowledge, yielding a reduction ranging from 9% to 23%.

Random Access Broadcast: Stability and Throughput Analysis
2007-04-20

Shrader,Brooke
Ephremides,Anthony

A wireless network in which packets are broadcast to a group of receivers
through use of a random access protocol is considered in this work. The
relation to previous work on networks of interacting queues is discussed and
subsequently, the stability and throughput regions of the system are analyzed
and presented. A simple network of two source nodes and two destination nodes
is considered first. The broadcast service process is analyzed assuming a
channel that allows for packet capture and multipacket reception. In this small
network, the stability and throughput regions are observed to coincide. The
same problem for a network with N sources and M destinations is considered
next. The channel model is simplified in that multipacket reception is no
longer permitted. Bounds on the stability region are developed using the
concept of stability rank and the throughput region of the system is compared
to the bounds. Our results show that as the number of destination nodes
increases, the stability and throughput regions diminish. Additionally, a
previous conjecture that the stability and throughput regions coincide for a
network of arbitrarily many sources is supported for a broadcast scenario by
the results presented in this work.

Writing on Dirty Paper with Resizing and its Application to Quasi-Static Fading Broadcast Channels
2007-04-20

Zhang,Wenyi
Kotagiri,Shivaprasad
Laneman,J. Nicholas

This paper studies a variant of the classical problem of ``writing on dirty
paper'' in which the sum of the input and the interference, or dirt, is
multiplied by a random variable that models resizing, known to the decoder but
not to the encoder. The achievable rate of Costa's dirty paper coding (DPC)
scheme is calculated and compared to the case of the decoder's also knowing the
dirt. In the ergodic case, the corresponding rate loss vanishes asymptotically
in the limits of both high and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and is small at
all finite SNR for typical distributions like Rayleigh, Rician, and Nakagami.
In the quasi-static case, the DPC scheme is lossless at all SNR in terms of
outage probability. Quasi-static fading broadcast channels (BC) without
transmit channel state information (CSI) are investigated as an application of
the robustness properties. It is shown that the DPC scheme leads to an outage
achievable rate region that strictly dominates that of time division.

Minimum cost distributed source coding over a network

2009-08-12
Ramamoorthy,Aditya

This work considers the problem of transmitting multiple compressible sources
over a network at minimum cost. The aim is to find the optimal rates at which
the sources should be compressed and the network flows using which they should
be transmitted so that the cost of the transmission is minimal. We consider
networks with capacity constraints and linear cost functions. The problem is
complicated by the fact that the description of the feasible rate region of
distributed source coding problems typically has a number of constraints that
is exponential in the number of sources. This renders general purpose solvers
inefficient. We present a framework in which these problems can be solved
efficiently by exploiting the structure of the feasible rate regions coupled
with dual decomposition and optimization techniques such as the subgradient
method and the proximal bundle method.

On Algebraic Decoding of $q$-ary Reed-Muller and Product-Reed-Solomon Codes

We consider a list decoding algorithm recently proposed by Pellikaan-Wu
\cite{PW2005} for $q$-ary Reed-Muller codes $\mathcal{RM}_q(\ell, m, n)$ of
length $n \leq q^m$ when $\ell \leq q$. A simple and easily accessible
correctness proof is given which shows that this algorithm achieves a relative
error-correction radius of $\tau \leq (1 - \sqrt{{\ell q^{m-1}}/{n}})$. This is
an improvement over the proof using one-point Algebraic-Geometric codes given
in \cite{PW2005}. The described algorithm can be adapted to decode
Product-Reed-Solomon codes.
  We then propose a new low complexity recursive algebraic decoding algorithm
for Reed-Muller and Product-Reed-Solomon codes. Our algorithm achieves a
relative error correction radius of $\tau \leq \prod_{i=1}^m (1 -
\sqrt{k_i/q})$. This technique is then proved to outperform the Pellikaan-Wu
method in both complexity and error correction radius over a wide range of code
rates.

A High-Throughput Cross-Layer Scheme for Distributed Wireless Ad Hoc Networks
2007-04-21

Petropulu,Athina P.
Dong,Lun
Poor,H. Vincent

In wireless ad hoc networks, distributed nodes can collaboratively form an
antenna array for long-distance communications to achieve high energy
efficiency. In recent work, Ochiai, et al., have shown that such collaborative
beamforming can achieve a statistically nice beampattern with a narrow main
lobe and low sidelobes. However, the process of collaboration introduces
significant delay, since all collaborating nodes need access to the same
information. In this paper, a technique that significantly reduces the
collaboration overhead is proposed. It consists of two phases. In the first
phase, nodes transmit locally in a random access fashion. Collisions, when they
occur, are viewed as linear mixtures of the collided packets. In the second
phase, a set of cooperating nodes acts as a distributed antenna system and
beamform the received analog waveform to one or more faraway destinations. This
step requires multiplication of the received analog waveform by a complex
number, which is independently computed by each cooperating node, and which
enables separation of the collided packets based on their final destination.
The scheme requires that each node has global knowledge of the network
coordinates. The proposed scheme can achieve high throughput, which in certain
cases exceeds one.

Nature-Inspired Interconnects for Self-Assembled Large-Scale Network-on-Chip Designs
2007-04-21

Teuscher,Christof

Future nano-scale electronics built up from an Avogadro number of components
needs efficient, highly scalable, and robust means of communication in order to
be competitive with traditional silicon approaches. In recent years, the
Networks-on-Chip (NoC) paradigm emerged as a promising solution to interconnect
challenges in silicon-based electronics. Current NoC architectures are either
highly regular or fully customized, both of which represent implausible
assumptions for emerging bottom-up self-assembled molecular electronics that
are generally assumed to have a high degree of irregularity and imperfection.
Here, we pragmatically and experimentally investigate important design
trade-offs and properties of an irregular, abstract, yet physically plausible
3D small-world interconnect fabric that is inspired by modern network-on-chip
paradigms. We vary the framework's key parameters, such as the connectivity,
the number of switch nodes, the distribution of long- versus short-range
connections, and measure the network's relevant communication characteristics.
We further explore the robustness against link failures and the ability and
efficiency to solve a simple toy problem, the synchronization task. The results
confirm that (1) computation in irregular assemblies is a promising and
disruptive computing paradigm for self-assembled nano-scale electronics and (2)
that 3D small-world interconnect fabrics with a power-law decaying distribution
of shortcut lengths are physically plausible and have major advantages over
local 2D and 3D regular topologies.

they are available much sooner, and that they are more accurate for recent

On Verifying and Engineering the Well-gradedness of a Union-closed Family
2007-04-23
2008-04-13
Eppstein,David
Falmagne,Jean-Claude
Uzun,Hasan

Current techniques for generating a knowledge space, such as QUERY,
guarantees that the resulting structure is closed under union, but not that it
satisfies wellgradedness, which is one of the defining conditions for a
learning space. We give necessary and sufficient conditions on the base of a
union-closed set family that ensures that the family is well-graded. We
consider two cases, depending on whether or not the family contains the empty
set. We also provide algorithms for efficiently testing these conditions, and
for augmenting a set family in a minimal way to one that satisfies these
conditions.

Optimal Routing for the Gaussian Multiple-Relay Channel with Decode-and-Forward
2007-04-23

Ong,Lawrence
Motani,Mehul

In this paper, we study a routing problem on the Gaussian multiple relay
channel, in which nodes employ a decode-and-forward coding strategy. We are
interested in routes for the information flow through the relays that achieve
the highest DF rate. We first construct an algorithm that provably finds
optimal DF routes. As the algorithm runs in factorial time in the worst case,
we propose a polynomial time heuristic algorithm that finds an optimal route
with high probability. We demonstrate that that the optimal (and near optimal)
DF routes are good in practice by simulating a distributed DF coding scheme
using low density parity check codes with puncturing and incremental
redundancy.

Using Access Data for Paper Recommendations on ArXiv.org
2007-04-23

Pohl,Stefan

This thesis investigates in the use of access log data as a source of
information for identifying related scientific papers. This is done for
arXiv.org, the authority for publication of e-prints in several fields of
physics.
  Compared to citation information, access logs have the advantage of being
immediately available, without manual or automatic extraction of the citation
graph. Because of that, a main focus is on the question, how far user behavior
can serve as a replacement for explicit meta-data, which potentially might be
expensive or completely unavailable. Therefore, we compare access, content, and
citation-based measures of relatedness on different recommendation tasks. As a
final result, an online recommendation system has been built that can help
scientists to find further relevant literature, without having to search for
them actively.

Arbitrary Rate Permutation Modulation for the Gaussian Channel
2007-04-23

Henkel,Oliver

In this paper non-group permutation modulated sequences for the Gaussian
channel are considered. Without the restriction to group codes rather than
subsets of group codes, arbitrary rates are achievable. The code construction
utilizes the known optimal group constellations to ensure at least the same
performance but exploit the Gray code ordering structure of multiset
permutations as a selection criterion at the decoder. The decoder achieves near
maximum likelihood performance at low computational cost and low additional
memory requirements at the receiver.

Achievable Rates for Two-Way Wire-Tap Channels
2007-04-23

Tekin,Ender
Yener,Aylin

We consider two-way wire-tap channels, where two users are communicating with
each other in the presence of an eavesdropper, who has access to the
communications through a multiple-access channel. We find achievable rates for
two different scenarios, the Gaussian two-way wire-tap channel, (GTW-WT), and
the binary additive two-way wire-tap channel, (BATW-WT). It is shown that the
two-way channels inherently provide a unique advantage for wire-tapped
scenarios, as the users know their own transmitted signals and in effect help
encrypt the other user's messages, similar to a one-time pad. We compare the
achievable rates to that of the Gaussian multiple-access wire-tap channel
(GMAC-WT) to illustrate this advantage.

Detection of two-sided alternatives in a Brownian motion model
2007-04-23

Hadjiliadis,Olympia
Poor,H. Vincent

This work examines the problem of sequential detection of a change in the
drift of a Brownian motion in the case of two-sided alternatives. Applications
to real life situations in which two-sided changes can occur are discussed.
Traditionally, 2-CUSUM stopping rules have been used for this problem due to
their asymptotically optimal character as the mean time between false alarms
tends to $\infty$. In particular, attention has focused on 2-CUSUM harmonic
mean rules due to the simplicity in calculating their first moments. In this
paper, we derive closed-form expressions for the first moment of a general
2-CUSUM stopping rule. We use these expressions to obtain explicit upper and
lower bounds for it. Moreover, we derive an expression for the rate of change
of this first moment as one of the threshold parameters changes. Based on these
expressions we obtain explicit upper and lower bounds to this rate of change.
Using these expressions we are able to find the best 2-CUSUM stopping rule with
respect to the extended Lorden criterion. In fact, we demonstrate not only the
existence but also the uniqueness of the best 2-CUSUM stopping both in the case
of a symmetric change and in the case of a non-symmetric case. Furthermore, we
discuss the existence of a modification of the 2-CUSUM stopping rule that has a
strictly better performance than its classical 2-CUSUM counterpart for small
values of the mean time between false alarms. We conclude with a discussion on
the open problem of strict optimality in the case of two-sided alternatives.

Space Time Codes from Permutation Codes
2007-04-24

Henkel,Oliver

A new class of space time codes with high performance is presented. The code
design utilizes tailor-made permutation codes, which are known to have large
minimal distances as spherical codes. A geometric connection between spherical
and space time codes has been used to translate them into the final space time
codes. Simulations demonstrate that the performance increases with the block
lengths, a result that has been conjectured already in previous work. Further,
the connection to permutation codes allows for moderate complex en-/decoding
algorithms.

Experimenting with recursive queries in database and logic programming systems
2007-04-24

Terracina,Giorgio
Leone,Nicola
Lio,Vincenzino
Panetta,Claudio

This paper considers the problem of reasoning on massive amounts of (possibly
distributed) data. Presently, existing proposals show some limitations: {\em
(i)} the quantity of data that can be handled contemporarily is limited, due to
the fact that reasoning is generally carried out in main-memory; {\em (ii)} the
interaction with external (and independent) DBMSs is not trivial and, in
several cases, not allowed at all; {\em (iii)} the efficiency of present
implementations is still not sufficient for their utilization in complex
reasoning tasks involving massive amounts of data. This paper provides a
contribution in this setting; it presents a new system, called DLV$^{DB}$,
which aims to solve these problems. Moreover, the paper reports the results of
a thorough experimental analysis we have carried out for comparing our system
with several state-of-the-art systems (both logic and databases) on some
classical deductive problems; the other tested systems are: LDL++, XSB, Smodels
and three top-level commercial DBMSs. DLV$^{DB}$ significantly outperforms even
the commercial Database Systems on recursive queries. To appear in Theory and

Computing modular polynomials in quasi-linear time
2007-04-24
2008-07-23
Enge,Andreas

We analyse and compare the complexity of several algorithms for computing
modular polynomials. We show that an algorithm relying on floating point
evaluation of modular functions and on interpolation, which has received little
attention in the literature, has a complexity that is essentially (up to
logarithmic factors) linear in the size of the computed polynomials. In
particular, it obtains the classical modular polynomials $\Phi_\ell$ of prime
level $\ell$ in time O (\ell^3 \log^4 \ell \log \log \ell). Besides treating
modular polynomials for $\Gamma^0 (\ell)$, which are an important ingredient in
many algorithms dealing with isogenies of elliptic curves, the algorithm is
easily adapted to more general situations. Composite levels are handled just as
easily as prime levels, as well as polynomials between a modular function and
its transform of prime level, such as the Schl\"afli polynomials and their
generalisations. Our distributed implementation of the algorithm confirms the
theoretical analysis by computing modular equations of record level around
10000 in less than two weeks on ten processors.

Generalized Stability Condition for Generalized and Doubly-Generalized LDPC Codes
2007-04-24

Paolini,E.
Fossorier,M.
Chiani,M.

In this paper, the stability condition for low-density parity-check (LDPC)
codes on the binary erasure channel (BEC) is extended to generalized LDPC
(GLDPC) codes and doublygeneralized LDPC (D-GLDPC) codes. It is proved that, in
both cases, the stability condition only involves the component codes with
minimum distance 2. The stability condition for GLDPC codes is always expressed
as an upper bound to the decoding threshold. This is not possible for D-GLDPC
codes, unless all the generalized variable nodes have minimum distance at least
3. Furthermore, a condition called derivative matching is defined in the paper.
This condition is sufficient for a GLDPC or DGLDPC code to achieve the
stability condition with equality. If this condition is satisfied, the
threshold of D-GLDPC codes (whose generalized variable nodes have all minimum
distance at least 3) and GLDPC codes can be expressed in closed form.

Characterization of P2P IPTV Traffic: Scaling Analysis
2007-04-24

Silverston,Thomas
Fourmaux,Olivier

P2P IPTV applications arise on the Internet and will be massively used in the
future. It is expected that P2P IPTV will contribute to increase the overall
Internet traffic. In this context, it is important to measure the impact of P2P
IPTV on the networks and to characterize this traffic. Dur- ing the 2006 FIFA
World Cup, we performed an extensive measurement campaign. We measured network
traffic generated by broadcasting soc- cer games by the most popular P2P IPTV
applications, namely PPLive, PPStream, SOPCast and TVAnts. From the collected
data, we charac- terized the P2P IPTV traffic structure at different time
scales by using wavelet based transform method. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first work, which presents a complete multiscale analysis of the
P2P IPTV traffic. Our results show that the scaling properties of the TCP
traffic present periodic behavior whereas the UDP traffic is stationary and
lead to long- range depedency characteristics. For all the applications, the
download traffic has different characteristics than the upload traffic. The
signaling traffic has a significant impact on the download traffic but it has
negligible impact on the upload. Both sides of the traffic and its granularity
has to be taken into account to design accurate P2P IPTV traffic models.

Alternative axiomatics and complexity of deliberative STIT theories

We propose two alternatives to Xu's axiomatization of the Chellas STIT. The
first one also provides an alternative axiomatization of the deliberative STIT.
The second one starts from the idea that the historic necessity operator can be
defined as an abbreviation of operators of agency, and can thus be eliminated
from the logic of the Chellas STIT. The second axiomatization also allows us to
establish that the problem of deciding the satisfiability of a STIT formula
without temporal operators is NP-complete in the single-agent case, and is
NEXPTIME-complete in the multiagent case, both for the deliberative and the
Chellas' STIT.

2D Path Solutions from a Single Layer Excitable CNN Model
2007-04-24

Karahaliloglu,Koray

An easily implementable path solution algorithm for 2D spatial problems,
based on excitable/programmable characteristics of a specific cellular
nonlinear network (CNN) model is presented and numerically investigated. The
network is a single layer bioinspired model which was also implemented in CMOS
technology. It exhibits excitable characteristics with regionally bistable
cells. The related response realizes propagations of trigger autowaves, where
the excitable mode can be globally preset and reset. It is shown that, obstacle
distributions in 2D space can also be directly mapped onto the coupled cell
array in the network. Combining these two features, the network model can serve
as the main block in a 2D path computing processor. The related algorithm and
configurations are numerically experimented with circuit level parameters and
performance estimations are also presented. The simplicity of the model also
allows alternative technology and device level implementation, which may become
critical in autonomous processor design of related micro or nanoscale robotic
applications.

Sample size cognizant detection of signals in white noise

Rao,N. Raj
Edelman,Alan

The detection and estimation of signals in noisy, limited data is a problem
of interest to many scientific and engineering communities. We present a
computationally simple, sample eigenvalue based procedure for estimating the
number of high-dimensional signals in white noise when there are relatively few
samples. We highlight a fundamental asymptotic limit of sample eigenvalue based
detection of weak high-dimensional signals from a limited sample size and
discuss its implication for the detection of two closely spaced signals.
  This motivates our heuristic definition of the 'effective number of
identifiable signals.' Numerical simulations are used to demonstrate the
consistency of the algorithm with respect to the effective number of signals
and the superior performance of the algorithm with respect to Wax and Kailath's
"asymptotically consistent" MDL based estimator.

Coalition Games with Cooperative Transmission: A Cure for the Curse of Boundary Nodes in Selfish Packet-Forwarding Wireless Networks
2007-04-25
2007-04-25
Han,Zhu
Poor,H. Vincent

In wireless packet-forwarding networks with selfish nodes, applications of a
repeated game can induce the nodes to forward each others' packets, so that the
network performance can be improved. However, the nodes on the boundary of such
networks cannot benefit from this strategy, as the other nodes do not depend on
them. This problem is sometimes known as the curse of the boundary nodes. To
overcome this problem, an approach based on coalition games is proposed, in
which the boundary nodes can use cooperative transmission to help the backbone
nodes in the middle of the network. In return, the backbone nodes are willing
to forward the boundary nodes' packets. The stability of the coalitions is
studied using the concept of a core. Then two types of fairness, namely, the
min-max fairness using nucleolus and the average fairness using the Shapley
function are investigated. Finally, a protocol is designed using both repeated
games and coalition games. Simulation results show how boundary nodes and
backbone nodes form coalitions together according to different fairness
criteria. The proposed protocol can improve the network connectivity by about
50%, compared with pure repeated game schemes.

Straggler Identification in Round-Trip Data Streams via Newton's Identities and Invertible Bloom Filters
2007-04-25
2009-09-10
Eppstein,David
Goodrich,Michael T.

We introduce the straggler identification problem, in which an algorithm must
determine the identities of the remaining members of a set after it has had a
large number of insertion and deletion operations performed on it, and now has
relatively few remaining members. The goal is to do this in o(n) space, where n
is the total number of identities. The straggler identification problem has
applications, for example, in determining the set of unacknowledged packets in
a high-bandwidth multicast data stream. We provide a deterministic solution to
the straggler identification problem that uses only O(d log n) bits and is
based on a novel application of Newton's identities for symmetric polynomials.
This solution can identify any subset of d stragglers from a set of n O(log
n)-bit identifiers, assuming that there are no false deletions of identities
not already in the set. Indeed, we give a lower bound argument that shows that
any small-space deterministic solution to the straggler identification problem
cannot be guaranteed to handle false deletions. Nevertheless, we show that
there is a simple randomized solution using O(d log n log(1/epsilon)) bits that
can maintain a multiset and solve the straggler identification problem,
tolerating false deletions, where epsilon>0 is a user-defined parameter
bounding the probability of an incorrect response. This randomized solution is
based on a new type of Bloom filter, which we call the invertible Bloom filter.

Vocabulary growth in collaborative tagging systems

We analyze a large-scale snapshot of del.icio.us and investigate how the
number of different tags in the system grows as a function of a suitably
defined notion of time. We study the temporal evolution of the global
vocabulary size, i.e. the number of distinct tags in the entire system, as well
as the evolution of local vocabularies, that is the growth of the number of
distinct tags used in the context of a given resource or user. In both cases,
we find power-law behaviors with exponents smaller than one. Surprisingly, the
observed growth behaviors are remarkably regular throughout the entire history
of the system and across very different resources being bookmarked. Similar
sub-linear laws of growth have been observed in written text, and this
qualitative universality calls for an explanation and points in the direction
of non-trivial cognitive processes in the complex interaction patterns

Direct Optimization of Ranking Measures
2007-04-25

Le,Quoc
Smola,Alexander

Web page ranking and collaborative filtering require the optimization of
sophisticated performance measures. Current Support Vector approaches are
unable to optimize them directly and focus on pairwise comparisons instead. We
present a new approach which allows direct optimization of the relevant loss
functions. This is achieved via structured estimation in Hilbert spaces. It is
most related to Max-Margin-Markov networks optimization of multivariate
performance measures. Key to our approach is that during training the ranking
problem can be viewed as a linear assignment problem, which can be solved by
the Hungarian Marriage algorithm. At test time, a sort operation is sufficient,
as our algorithm assigns a relevance score to every (document, query) pair.
Experiments show that the our algorithm is fast and that it works very well.

Lifetime Improvement in Wireless Sensor Networks via Collaborative Beamforming and Cooperative Transmission
2007-04-25
2007-04-25
Han,Zhu
Poor,H. Vincent

Collaborative beamforming (CB) and cooperative transmission (CT) have
recently emerged as communication techniques that can make effective use of
collaborative/cooperative nodes to create a virtual
multiple-input/multiple-output (MIMO) system. Extending the lifetime of
networks composed of battery-operated nodes is a key issue in the design and
operation of wireless sensor networks. This paper considers the effects on
network lifetime of allowing closely located nodes to use CB/CT to reduce the
load or even to avoid packet-forwarding requests to nodes that have critical
battery life. First, the effectiveness of CB/CT in improving the signal
strength at a faraway destination using energy in nearby nodes is studied.
Then, the performance improvement obtained by this technique is analyzed for a
special 2D disk case. Further, for general networks in which
information-generation rates are fixed, a new routing problem is formulated as
a linear programming problem, while for other general networks, the cost for
routing is dynamically adjusted according to the amount of energy remaining and
the effectiveness of CB/CT. From the analysis and the simulation results, it is
seen that the proposed method can reduce the payloads of energy-depleting nodes
by about 90% in the special case network considered and improve the lifetimes
of general networks by about 10%, compared with existing techniques.

Lifetime Improvement of Wireless Sensor Networks by Collaborative Beamforming and Cooperative Transmission

Extending network lifetime of battery-operated devices is a key design issue
that allows uninterrupted information exchange among distributive nodes in
wireless sensor networks. Collaborative beamforming (CB) and cooperative
transmission (CT) have recently emerged as new communication techniques that
enable and leverage effective resource sharing among collaborative/cooperative
nodes. In this paper, we seek to maximize the lifetime of sensor networks by
using the new idea that closely located nodes can use CB/CT to reduce the load
or even avoid packet forwarding requests to nodes that have critical battery
life. First, we study the effectiveness of CB/CT to improve the signal strength
at a faraway destination using energy in nearby nodes. Then, a 2D disk case is
analyzed to assess the resulting performance improvement. For general networks,
if information-generation rates are fixed, the new routing problem is
formulated as a linear programming problem; otherwise, the cost for routing is
dynamically adjusted according to the amount of energy remaining and the
effectiveness of CB/CT. From the analysis and simulation results, it is seen
that the proposed schemes can improve the lifetime by about 90% in the 2D disk
network and by about 10% in the general networks, compared to existing schemes.

Cooperative Transmission Protocols with High Spectral Efficiency and High Diversity Order Using Multiuser Detection and Network Coding
2007-04-25

Han,Zhu
Zhang,Xin
Poor,H. Vincent

Cooperative transmission is an emerging communication technique that takes
advantages of the broadcast nature of wireless channels. However, due to low
spectral efficiency and the requirement of orthogonal channels, its potential
for use in future wireless networks is limited. In this paper, by making use of
multiuser detection (MUD) and network coding, cooperative transmission
protocols with high spectral efficiency, diversity order, and coding gain are
developed. Compared with the traditional cooperative transmission protocols
with single-user detection, in which the diversity gain is only for one source
user, the proposed MUD cooperative transmission protocols have the merits that
the improvement of one user's link can also benefit the other users. In
addition, using MUD at the relay provides an environment in which network
coding can be employed. The coding gain and high diversity order can be
obtained by fully utilizing the link between the relay and the destination.
  From the analysis and simulation results, it is seen that the proposed
protocols achieve higher diversity gain, better asymptotic efficiency, and
lower bit error rate, compared to traditional MUD and to existing cooperative
transmission protocols.

Diversity-Multiplexing Tradeoff in Selective-Fading MIMO Channels

We establish the optimal diversity-multiplexing (DM) tradeoff of coherent
time, frequency and time-frequency selective-fading MIMO channels and provide a
code design criterion for DM-tradeoff optimality. Our results are based on the
analysis of the "Jensen channel" associated to a given selective-fading MIMO
channel. While the original problem seems analytically intractable due to the
mutual information being a sum of correlated random variables, the Jensen
channel is equivalent to the original channel in the sense of the DM-tradeoff
and lends itself nicely to analytical treatment. Finally, as a consequence of
our results, we find that the classical rank criterion for space-time code
design (in selective-fading MIMO channels) ensures optimality in the sense of
the DM-tradeoff.

Estimation Diversity and Energy Efficiency in Distributed Sensing
2007-04-25

Cui,Shuguang
Xiao,Jinjun
Goldsmith,Andrea
Luo,Zhi-Quan

Distributed estimation based on measurements from multiple wireless sensors
is investigated. It is assumed that a group of sensors observe the same
quantity in independent additive observation noises with possibly different
variances. The observations are transmitted using amplify-and-forward (analog)
transmissions over non-ideal fading wireless channels from the sensors to a
fusion center, where they are combined to generate an estimate of the observed
quantity. Assuming that the Best Linear Unbiased Estimator (BLUE) is used by
the fusion center, the equal-power transmission strategy is first discussed,
where the system performance is analyzed by introducing the concept of
estimation outage and estimation diversity, and it is shown that there is an
achievable diversity gain on the order of the number of sensors. The optimal
power allocation strategies are then considered for two cases: minimum
distortion under power constraints; and minimum power under distortion
constraints. In the first case, it is shown that by turning off bad sensors,
i.e., sensors with bad channels and bad observation quality, adaptive power
gain can be achieved without sacrificing diversity gain. Here, the adaptive
power gain is similar to the array gain achieved in Multiple-Input
Single-Output (MISO) multi-antenna systems when channel conditions are known to
the transmitter. In the second case, the sum power is minimized under
zero-outage estimation distortion constraint, and some related energy
efficiency issues in sensor networks are discussed.

The Trade-off between Processing Gains of an Impulse Radio UWB System in the Presence of Timing Jitter
2007-04-25

Gezici,Sinan
Molisch,Andreas F.
Poor,H. Vincent
Kobayashi,Hisashi

In time hopping impulse radio, $N_f$ pulses of duration $T_c$ are transmitted
for each information symbol. This gives rise to two types of processing gain:
(i) pulse combining gain, which is a factor $N_f$, and (ii) pulse spreading
gain, which is $N_c=T_f/T_c$, where $T_f$ is the mean interval between two
subsequent pulses. This paper investigates the trade-off between these two
types of processing gain in the presence of timing jitter. First, an additive
white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel is considered and approximate closed form
expressions for bit error probability are derived for impulse radio systems
with and without pulse-based polarity randomization. Both symbol-synchronous
and chip-synchronous scenarios are considered. The effects of multiple-access
interference and timing jitter on the selection of optimal system parameters
are explained through theoretical analysis. Finally, a multipath scenario is
considered and the trade-off between processing gains of a synchronous impulse
radio system with pulse-based polarity randomization is analyzed. The effects
of the timing jitter, multiple-access interference and inter-frame interference
are investigated. Simulation studies support the theoretical results.

This paper proposes an approach to training rough set models using Bayesian
framework trained using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. The prior
probabilities are constructed from the prior knowledge that good rough set
models have fewer rules. Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling is conducted through
sampling in the rough set granule space and Metropolis algorithm is used as an
acceptance criteria. The proposed method is tested to estimate the risk of HIV
given demographic data. The results obtained shows that the proposed approach
is able to achieve an average accuracy of 58% with the accuracy varying up to
66%. In addition the Bayesian rough set give the probabilities of the estimated
HIV status as well as the linguistic rules describing how the demographic
parameters drive the risk of HIV.

On sensing capacity of sensor networks for the class of linear observation, fixed SNR models
2007-04-25
2007-06-04
Aeron,Shuchin
Zhao,Manqi
Saligrama,Venkatesh

In this paper we address the problem of finding the sensing capacity of
sensor networks for a class of linear observation models and a fixed SNR
regime. Sensing capacity is defined as the maximum number of signal dimensions
reliably identified per sensor observation. In this context sparsity of the
phenomena is a key feature that determines sensing capacity. Precluding the SNR
of the environment the effect of sparsity on the number of measurements
required for accurate reconstruction of a sparse phenomena has been widely
dealt with under compressed sensing. Nevertheless the development there was
motivated from an algorithmic perspective. In this paper our aim is to derive
these bounds in an information theoretic set-up and thus provide algorithm
independent conditions for reliable reconstruction of sparse signals. In this
direction we first generalize the Fano's inequality and provide lower bounds to
the probability of error in reconstruction subject to an arbitrary distortion
criteria. Using these lower bounds to the probability of error, we derive upper
bounds to sensing capacity and show that for fixed SNR regime sensing capacity
goes down to zero as sparsity goes down to zero. This means that
disproportionately more sensors are required to monitor very sparse events. Our
next main contribution is that we show the effect of sensing diversity on
sensing capacity, an effect that has not been considered before. Sensing
diversity is related to the effective \emph{coverage} of a sensor with respect
to the field. In this direction we show the following results (a) Sensing
capacity goes down as sensing diversity per sensor goes down; (b) Random
sampling (coverage) of the field by sensors is better than contiguous location
sampling (coverage).

knowledge. This problem of static classification models is addressed in this
paper by the introduction of incremental learning for problems in
bioinformatics. Many machine learning tools have been applied to this problem
using static machine learning structures such as neural networks or support
vector machines that are unable to accommodate new information into their
existing models. We utilize the fuzzy ARTMAP as an alternate machine learning
system that has the ability of incrementally learning new data as it becomes
available. The fuzzy ARTMAP is found to be comparable to many of the widespread
machine learning systems. The use of an evolutionary strategy in the selection
and combination of individual classifiers into an ensemble system, coupled with
the incremental learning ability of the fuzzy ARTMAP is proven to be suitable
as a pattern classifier. The algorithm presented is tested using data from the
G-Coupled Protein Receptors Database and shows good accuracy of 83%. The system
presented is also generally applicable, and can be used in problems in genomics
and proteomics.

Polynomial algorithms for protein similarity search for restricted mRNA structures
2007-04-26

Gurski,Frank

In this paper we consider the problem of computing an mRNA sequence of
maximal similarity for a given mRNA of secondary structure constraints,
introduced by Backofen et al. in [BNS02] denoted as the MRSO problem. The
problem is known to be NP-complete for planar associated implied structure
graphs of vertex degree at most 3. In [BFHV05] a first polynomial dynamic
programming algorithms for MRSO on implied structure graphs with maximum vertex
degree 3 of bounded cut-width is shown. We give a simple but more general
polynomial dynamic programming solution for the MRSO problem for associated
implied structure graphs of bounded clique-width. Our result implies that MRSO
is polynomial for graphs of bounded tree-width, co-graphs, $P_4$-sparse graphs,
and distance hereditary graphs. Further we conclude that the problem of
comparing two solutions for MRSO is hard for the class of problems which can be
solved in polynomial time with a number of parallel queries to an oracle in NP.

Une plate-forme dynamique pour l'\'evaluation des performances des bases de donn\'ees \`a objets
2007-04-26

He,Zhen
Darmont,Jérôme

In object-oriented or object-relational databases such as multimedia
databases or most XML databases, access patterns are not static, i.e.,
applications do not always access the same objects in the same order
repeatedly. However, this has been the way these databases and associated
optimisation techniques such as clustering have been evaluated up to now. This
paper opens up research regarding this issue by proposing a dynamic object
evaluation framework (DOEF). DOEF accomplishes access pattern change by
defining configurable styles of change. It is a preliminary prototype that has
been designed to be open and fully extensible. Though originally designed for
the object-oriented model, it can also be used within the object-relational
model with few adaptations. Furthermore, new access pattern change models can
be added too. To illustrate the capabilities of DOEF, we conducted two
different sets of experiments. In the first set of experiments, we used DOEF to
compare the performances of four state of the art dynamic clustering
algorithms. The results show that DOEF is effective at determining the
adaptability of each dynamic clustering algorithm to changes in access pattern.
They also led us to conclude that dynamic clustering algorithms can cope with
moderate levels of access pattern change, but that performance rapidly degrades
to be worse than no clustering when vigorous styles of access pattern change
are applied. In the second set of experiments, we used DOEF to compare the
performance of two different object stores: Platypus and SHORE. The use of DOEF
exposed the poor swapping performance of Platypus.

We present in this paper a new benchmark for evaluating the performances of
data warehouses. Benchmarking is useful either to system users for comparing
the performances of different systems, or to system engineers for testing the
effect of various design choices. While the TPC (Transaction Processing
Performance Council) standard benchmarks address the first point, they are not
tuneable enough to address the second one. Our Data Warehouse Engineering
Benchmark (DWEB) allows to generate various ad-hoc synthetic data warehouses
and workloads. DWEB is fully parameterized. However, two levels of
parameterization keep it easy to tune. Since DWEB mainly meets engineering
benchmarking needs, it is complimentary to the TPC standard benchmarks, and not
a competitor. Finally, DWEB is implemented as a Java free software that can be
interfaced with most existing relational database management systems.

Comparing Robustness of Pairwise and Multiclass Neural-Network Systems for Face Recognition
2007-04-26

Uglov,J.
Schetinin,V.
Maple,C.

Noise, corruptions and variations in face images can seriously hurt the
performance of face recognition systems. To make such systems robust,
multiclass neuralnetwork classifiers capable of learning from noisy data have
been suggested. However on large face data sets such systems cannot provide the
robustness at a high level. In this paper we explore a pairwise neural-network
system as an alternative approach to improving the robustness of face
recognition. In our experiments this approach is shown to outperform the
multiclass neural-network system in terms of the predictive accuracy on the
face images corrupted by noise.

With the wide development of databases in general and data warehouses in
particular, it is important to reduce the tasks that a database administrator
must perform manually. The idea of using data mining techniques to extract
useful knowledge for administration from the data themselves has existed for
some years. However, little research has been achieved. The aim of this study
is to search for a way of extracting useful knowledge from stored data to
automatically apply performance optimization techniques, and more particularly
indexing techniques. We have designed a tool that extracts frequent itemsets
from a given workload to compute an index configuration that helps optimizing
data access time. The experiments we performed showed that the index
configurations generated by our tool allowed performance gains of 15% to 25% on
a test database and a test data warehouse.

$\delta$-sequences and Evaluation Codes defined by Plane Valuations at Infinity

Galindo,C.
Monserrat,F.

We introduce the concept of $\delta$-sequence. A $\delta$-sequence $\Delta$
generates a well-ordered semigroup $S$ in $\mathbb{Z}^2$ or $\mathbb{R}$. We
show how to construct (and compute parameters) for the dual code of any
evaluation code associated with a weight function defined by $\Delta$ from the
polynomial ring in two indeterminates to a semigroup $S$ as above. We prove
that this is a simple procedure which can be understood by considering a
particular class of valuations of function fields of surfaces, called plane
valuations at infinity. We also give algorithms to construct an unlimited
number of $\delta$-sequences of the different existing types, and so this paper
provides the tools to know and use a new large set of codes.

On Energy Efficient Hierarchical Cross-Layer Design: Joint Power Control and Routing for Ad Hoc Networks
2007-04-26

Comaniciu,Cristina
Poor,H. Vincent

In this paper, a hierarchical cross-layer design approach is proposed to
increase energy efficiency in ad hoc networks through joint adaptation of
nodes' transmitting powers and route selection. The design maintains the
advantages of the classic OSI model, while accounting for the cross-coupling
between layers, through information sharing. The proposed joint power control
and routing algorithm is shown to increase significantly the overall energy
efficiency of the network, at the expense of a moderate increase in complexity.
Performance enhancement of the joint design using multiuser detection is also
investigated, and it is shown that the use of multiuser detection can increase
the capacity of the ad hoc network significantly for a given level of energy
consumption.

Capacity of a Class of Modulo-Sum Relay Channels

This paper characterizes the capacity of a class of modulo additive noise
relay channels, in which the relay observes a corrupted version of the noise
and has a separate channel to the destination. The capacity is shown to be
strictly below the cut-set bound in general and achievable using a
quantize-and-forward strategy at the relay. This result confirms a conjecture
by Ahlswede and Han about the capacity of channels with rate limited state
information at the destination for this particular class of channels.

Many techniques for handling missing data have been proposed in the

approximations for incompletely specified decision tables may be defined in a
variety of different ways. Empirical results obtained using real data are given
and they provide a valuable and promising insight to the problem of missing

Capacity Gain from Two-Transmitter and Two-Receiver Cooperation
2007-04-26

Ng,Chris T. K.
Jindal,Nihar
Goldsmith,Andrea J.
Mitra,Urbashi

Capacity improvement from transmitter and receiver cooperation is
investigated in a two-transmitter, two-receiver network with phase fading and
full channel state information available at all terminals. The transmitters
cooperate by first exchanging messages over an orthogonal transmitter
cooperation channel, then encoding jointly with dirty paper coding. The
receivers cooperate by using Wyner-Ziv compress-and-forward over an analogous
orthogonal receiver cooperation channel. To account for the cost of
cooperation, the allocation of network power and bandwidth among the data and
cooperation channels is studied. It is shown that transmitter cooperation
outperforms receiver cooperation and improves capacity over non-cooperative
transmission under most operating conditions when the cooperation channel is
strong. However, a weak cooperation channel limits the transmitter cooperation
rate; in this case receiver cooperation is more advantageous.
Transmitter-and-receiver cooperation offers sizable additional capacity gain
over transmitter-only cooperation at low SNR, whereas at high SNR transmitter
cooperation alone captures most of the cooperative capacity improvement.

Lower Bounds on Implementing Robust and Resilient Mediators

We consider games that have (k,t)-robust equilibria when played with a
mediator, where an equilibrium is (k,t)-robust if it tolerates deviations by
coalitions of size up to k and deviations by up to $t$ players with unknown
utilities. We prove lower bounds that match upper bounds on the ability to
implement such mediators using cheap talk (that is, just allowing communication
among the players). The bounds depend on (a) the relationship between k, t, and
n, the total number of players in the system; (b) whether players know the
exact utilities of other players; (c) whether there are broadcast channels or
just point-to-point channels; (d) whether cryptography is available; and (e)
whether the game has a $k+t)-punishment strategy; that is, a strategy that, if
used by all but at most $k+t$ players, guarantees that every player gets a
worse outcome than they do with the equilibrium strategy.

Evaluating Personal Archiving Strategies for Internet-based Information
2007-04-26

Marshall,Catherine C.
McCown,Frank
Nelson,Michael L.

Internet-based personal digital belongings present different vulnerabilities
than locally stored materials. We use responses to a survey of people who have
recovered lost websites, in combination with supplementary interviews, to paint
a fuller picture of current curatorial strategies and practices. We examine the
types of personal, topical, and commercial websites that respondents have lost
and the reasons they have lost this potentially valuable material. We further
explore what they have tried to recover and how the loss influences their
subsequent practices. We found that curation of personal digital materials in
online stores bears some striking similarities to the curation of similar
materials stored locally in that study participants continue to archive
personal assets by relying on a combination of benign neglect, sporadic
backups, and unsystematic file replication. However, we have also identified
issues specific to Internet-based material: how risk is spread by distributing
the files among multiple servers and services; the circular reasoning
participants use when they discuss the safety of their digital assets; and the
types of online material that are particularly vulnerable to loss. The study
reveals ways in which expectations of permanence and notification are violated
and situations in which benign neglect has far greater consequences for the
long-term fate of important digital assets.

The Long Term Fate of Our Digital Belongings: Toward a Service Model for Personal Archives
2007-04-26

Marshall,Catherine C.
Bly,Sara
Brun-Cottan,Francoise

We conducted a preliminary field study to understand the current state of
personal digital archiving in practice. Our aim is to design a service for the
long-term storage, preservation, and access of digital belongings by examining
how personal archiving needs intersect with existing and emerging archiving
technologies, best practices, and policies. Our findings not only confirmed
that experienced home computer users are creating, receiving, and finding an
increasing number of digital belongings, but also that they have already lost
irreplaceable digital artifacts such as photos, creative efforts, and records.
Although participants reported strategies such as backup and file replication
for digital safekeeping, they were seldom able to implement them consistently.
Four central archiving themes emerged from the data: (1) people find it
difficult to evaluate the worth of accumulated materials; (2) personal storage
is highly distributed both on- and offline; (3) people are experiencing
magnified curatorial problems associated with managing files in the aggregate,
creating appropriate metadata, and migrating materials to maintainable formats;
and (4) facilities for long-term access are not supported by the current
desktop metaphor. Four environmental factors further complicate archiving in
consumer settings: the pervasive influence of malware; consumer reliance on ad
hoc IT providers; an accretion of minor system and registry inconsistencies;
and strong consumer beliefs about the incorruptibility of digital forms, the
reliability of digital technologies, and the social vulnerability of networked
storage.

An Automated Evaluation Metric for Chinese Text Entry

In this paper, we propose an automated evaluation metric for text entry. We
also consider possible improvements to existing text entry evaluation metrics,
such as the minimum string distance error rate, keystrokes per character, cost
per correction, and a unified approach proposed by MacKenzie, so they can
accommodate the special characteristics of Chinese text. Current methods lack
an integrated concern about both typing speed and accuracy for Chinese text
entry evaluation. Our goal is to remove the bias that arises due to human
factors. First, we propose a new metric, called the correction penalty (P),
based on Fitts' law and Hick's law. Next, we transform it into the approximate
amortized cost (AAC) of information theory. An analysis of the AAC of Chinese
text input methods with different context lengths is also presented.

This paper gives a dichotomy theorem for the complexity of computing the
partition function of an instance of a weighted Boolean constraint satisfaction
problem. The problem is parameterised by a finite set F of non-negative
functions that may be used to assign weights to the configurations (feasible
solutions) of a problem instance. Classical constraint satisfaction problems
correspond to the special case of 0,1-valued functions. We show that the
partition function, i.e. the sum of the weights of all configurations, can be
computed in polynomial time if either (1) every function in F is of ``product
type'', or (2) every function in F is ``pure affine''. For every other fixed
set F, computing the partition function is FP^{#P}-complete.

Network statistics on early English Syntax: Structural criteria
2007-04-27
2007-04-30
Corominas-Murtra,Bernat

This paper includes a reflection on the role of networks in the study of
English language acquisition, as well as a collection of practical criteria to
annotate free-speech corpora from children utterances. At the theoretical
level, the main claim of this paper is that syntactic networks should be
interpreted as the outcome of the use of the syntactic machinery. Thus, the
intrinsic features of such machinery are not accessible directly from (known)
network properties. Rather, what one can see are the global patterns of its use
and, thus, a global view of the power and organization of the underlying
grammar. Taking a look into more practical issues, the paper examines how to
build a net from the projection of syntactic relations. Recall that, as opposed
to adult grammars, early-child language has not a well-defined concept of
structure. To overcome such difficulty, we develop a set of systematic criteria
assuming constituency hierarchy and a grammar based on lexico-thematic
relations. At the end, what we obtain is a well defined corpora annotation that
enables us i) to perform statistics on the size of structures and ii) to build
a network from syntactic relations over which we can perform the standard
measures of complexity. We also provide a detailed example.

Distributed Algorithms for Spectrum Allocation, Power Control, Routing, and Congestion Control in Wireless Networks
2007-04-27

Xi,Yufang
Yeh,Edmund M.

We develop distributed algorithms to allocate resources in multi-hop wireless
networks with the aim of minimizing total cost. In order to observe the
fundamental duplexing constraint that co-located transmitters and receivers
cannot operate simultaneously on the same frequency band, we first devise a
spectrum allocation scheme that divides the whole spectrum into multiple
sub-bands and activates conflict-free links on each sub-band. We show that the
minimum number of required sub-bands grows asymptotically at a logarithmic rate
with the chromatic number of network connectivity graph. A simple distributed
and asynchronous algorithm is developed to feasibly activate links on the
available sub-bands. Given a feasible spectrum allocation, we then design
node-based distributed algorithms for optimally controlling the transmission
powers on active links for each sub-band, jointly with traffic routes and user
input rates in response to channel states and traffic demands. We show that
under specified conditions, the algorithms asymptotically converge to the
optimal operating point.

Avoiding Rotated Bitboards with Direct Lookup

Tannous,Sam

This paper describes an approach for obtaining direct access to the attacked
squares of sliding pieces without resorting to rotated bitboards. The technique
involves creating four hash tables using the built in hash arrays from an
interpreted, high level language. The rank, file, and diagonal occupancy are
first isolated by masking the desired portion of the board. The attacked
squares are then directly retrieved from the hash tables. Maintaining
incrementally updated rotated bitboards becomes unnecessary as does all the
updating, mapping and shifting required to access the attacked squares.
Finally, rotated bitboard move generation speed is compared with that of the
direct hash table lookup method.

Stochastic Optimization Algorithms

When looking for a solution, deterministic methods have the enormous
advantage that they do find global optima. Unfortunately, they are very
CPU-intensive, and are useless on untractable NP-hard problems that would
require thousands of years for cutting-edge computers to explore. In order to
get a result, one needs to revert to stochastic algorithms, that sample the
search space without exploring it thoroughly. Such algorithms can find very
good results, without any guarantee that the global optimum has been reached;
but there is often no other choice than using them. This chapter is a short
introduction to the main methods used in stochastic optimization.

neighbourhoods, given a predetermined number of colours. In the analytical
framework of a tree approximation, carried out at both zero and finite

of the threshold connectivity for the incomplete to complete transition, which
are consistent with those of existing algorithms. The nature of the transition
as well as the validity of the tree approximation are investigated.

A Game-Theoretic Approach to Energy-Efficient Modulation in CDMA Networks with Delay Constraints
2007-04-30

Meshkati,Farhad
Goldsmith,Andrea J.
Poor,H. Vincent
Schwartz,Stuart C.

A game-theoretic framework is used to study the effect of constellation size
on the energy efficiency of wireless networks for M-QAM modulation. A
non-cooperative game is proposed in which each user seeks to choose its
transmit power (and possibly transmit symbol rate) as well as the constellation
size in order to maximize its own utility while satisfying its delay
quality-of-service (QoS) constraint. The utility function used here measures
the number of reliable bits transmitted per joule of energy consumed, and is
particularly suitable for energy-constrained networks. The best-response
strategies and Nash equilibrium solution for the proposed game are derived. It
is shown that in order to maximize its utility (in bits per joule), a user must
choose the lowest constellation size that can accommodate the user's delay
constraint. Using this framework, the tradeoffs among energy efficiency, delay,
throughput and constellation size are also studied and quantified. The effect
of trellis-coded modulation on energy efficiency is also discussed.

Energy-Efficient Resource Allocation in Wireless Networks with Quality-of-Service Constraints

Schwartz,Stuart C.
Balan,Radu V.

A game-theoretic model is proposed to study the cross-layer problem of joint
power and rate control with quality of service (QoS) constraints in
multiple-access networks. In the proposed game, each user seeks to choose its
transmit power and rate in a distributed manner in order to maximize its own
utility while satisfying its QoS requirements. The user's QoS constraints are
specified in terms of the average source rate and an upper bound on the average
delay where the delay includes both transmission and queuing delays. The
utility function considered here measures energy efficiency and is particularly
suitable for wireless networks with energy constraints. The Nash equilibrium
solution for the proposed non-cooperative game is derived and a closed-form
expression for the utility achieved at equilibrium is obtained. It is shown
that the QoS requirements of a user translate into a "size" for the user which
is an indication of the amount of network resources consumed by the user. Using
this competitive multiuser framework, the tradeoffs among throughput, delay,
network capacity and energy efficiency are studied. In addition, analytical
expressions are given for users' delay profiles and the delay performance of
the users at Nash equilibrium is quantified.

A Unified Approach to Energy-Efficient Power Control in Large CDMA Systems
2007-04-30

Meshkati,Farhad
Guo,Dongning
Poor,H. Vincent
Schwartz,Stuart C.

A unified approach to energy-efficient power control is proposed for
code-division multiple access (CDMA) networks. The approach is applicable to a
large family of multiuser receivers including the matched filter, the
decorrelator, the linear minimum mean-square error (MMSE) receiver, and the
(nonlinear) optimal detectors. It exploits the linear relationship that has
been shown to exist between the transmit power and the output
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SIR) in the large-system limit. It is
shown that, for this family of receivers, when users seek to selfishly maximize
their own energy efficiency, the Nash equilibrium is SIR-balanced. In addition,
a unified power control (UPC) algorithm for reaching the Nash equilibrium is
proposed. The algorithm adjusts the user's transmit powers by iteratively
computing the large-system multiuser efficiency, which is independent of
instantaneous spreading sequences. The convergence of the algorithm is proved
for the matched filter, the decorrelator, and the MMSE receiver, and is
demonstrated by means of simulation for an optimal detector. Moreover, the
performance of the algorithm in finite-size systems is studied and compared
with that of a conventional power control scheme, in which user powers depend
on the instantaneous spreading sequences.

An algorithm for clock synchronization with the gradient property in sensor networks

Pussente,Rodolfo M.
Barbosa,Valmir C.

We introduce a distributed algorithm for clock synchronization in sensor
networks. Our algorithm assumes that nodes in the network only know their
immediate neighborhoods and an upper bound on the network's diameter.
Clock-synchronization messages are only sent as part of the communication,
assumed reasonably frequent, that already takes place among nodes. The
algorithm has the gradient property of [2], achieving an O(1) worst-case skew
between the logical clocks of neighbors. As in the case of [3,8], the
algorithm's actions are such that no constant lower bound exists on the rate at
which logical clocks progress in time, and for this reason the lower bound of
[2,5] that forbids constant skew between neighbors does not apply.

In this work we study preference systems natural for the Peer-to-Peer
paradigm. Most of them fall in three categories: global, symmetric and
complementary. All these systems share an acyclicity property. As a
consequence, they admit a stable (or Pareto efficient) configuration, where no
participant can collaborate with better partners than their current ones. We
analyze the representation of the such preference systems and show that any
acyclic system can be represented with a symmetric mark matrix. This gives a
method to merge acyclic preference systems and retain the acyclicity. We also
consider such properties of the corresponding collaboration graph, as
clustering coefficient and diameter. In particular, studying the example of
preferences based on real latency measurements, we observe that its stable
configuration is a small-world graph.

last decade, proceeds by building a population of diverse classifiers. Ensemble
Learning with Evolutionary Computation thus receives increasing attention. The
Evolutionary Ensemble Learning (EEL) approach presented in this paper features
two contributions. First, a new fitness function, inspired by co-evolution and
enforcing the classifier diversity, is presented. Further, a new selection
criterion based on the classification margin is proposed. This criterion is
used to extract the classifier ensemble from the final population only
(Off-line) or incrementally along evolution (On-line). Experiments on a set of
benchmark problems show that Off-line outperforms single-hypothesis
evolutionary learning and state-of-art Boosting and generates smaller
classifier ensembles.

The Complexity of Model Checking Higher-Order Fixpoint Logic
2007-04-30
2007-06-29
Axelsson,Roland
Lange,Martin
Somla,Rafal

Higher-Order Fixpoint Logic (HFL) is a hybrid of the simply typed
\lambda-calculus and the modal \lambda-calculus. This makes it a highly
expressive temporal logic that is capable of expressing various interesting
correctness properties of programs that are not expressible in the modal
\lambda-calculus.
  This paper provides complexity results for its model checking problem. In
particular we consider those fragments of HFL built by using only types of
bounded order k and arity m. We establish k-fold exponential time completeness
for model checking each such fragment. For the upper bound we use fixpoint
elimination to obtain reachability games that are singly-exponential in the
size of the formula and k-fold exponential in the size of the underlying
transition system. These games can be solved in deterministic linear time. As a
simple consequence, we obtain an exponential time upper bound on the expression
complexity of each such fragment.
  The lower bound is established by a reduction from the word problem for
alternating (k-1)-fold exponential space bounded Turing Machines. Since there
are fixed machines of that type whose word problems are already hard with
respect to k-fold exponential time, we obtain, as a corollary, k-fold
exponential time completeness for the data complexity of our fragments of HFL,
provided m exceeds 3. This also yields a hierarchy result in expressive power.

Diversity of MIMO Multihop Relay Channels - Part I: Amplify-and-Forward
2007-04-30

Yang,Sheng
Belfiore,Jean-Claude

In this two-part paper, we consider the multiantenna multihop relay channels
in which the source signal arrives at the destination through N independent
relaying hops in series. The main concern of this work is to design relaying
strategies that utilize efficiently the relays in such a way that the diversity
is maximized. In part I, we focus on the amplify-and-forward (AF) strategy with
which the relays simply scale the received signal and retransmit it. More
specifically, we characterize the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff (DMT) of the
AF scheme in a general multihop channel with arbitrary number of antennas and
arbitrary number of hops. The DMT is in closed-form expression as a function of
the number of antennas at each node. First, we provide some basic results on
the DMT of the general Rayleigh product channels. It turns out that these
results have very simple and intuitive interpretation. Then, the results are
applied to the AF multihop channels which is shown to be equivalent to the
Rayleigh product channel, in the DMT sense. Finally, the project-and-forward
(PF) scheme, a variant of the AF scheme, is proposed. We show that the PF
scheme has the same DMT as the AF scheme, while the PF can have significant
power gain over the AF scheme in some cases. In part II, we will derive the
upper bound on the diversity of the multihop channels and show that it can be
achieved by partitioning the multihop channel into AF subchannels.

Critical phenomena in complex networks

Mendes,J. F. F.

The combination of the compactness of networks, featuring small diameters,
and their complex architectures results in a variety of critical effects
dramatically different from those in cooperative systems on lattices. In the
last few years, researchers have made important steps toward understanding the
qualitatively new critical phenomena in complex networks. We review the
results, concepts, and methods of this rapidly developing field. Here we mostly
consider two closely related classes of these critical phenomena, namely
structural phase transitions in the network architectures and transitions in
cooperative models on networks as substrates. We also discuss systems where a
network and interacting agents on it influence each other. We overview a wide
range of critical phenomena in equilibrium and growing networks including the
birth of the giant connected component, percolation, k-core percolation,
phenomena near epidemic thresholds, condensation transitions, critical
phenomena in spin models placed on networks, synchronization, and
self-organized criticality effects in interacting systems on networks. We also
discuss strong finite size effects in these systems and highlight open problems
and perspectives.

Checking Equivalence of Quantum Circuits and States

Viamontes,George F.
Markov,Igor L.
Hayes,John P.

Quantum computing promises exponential speed-ups for important simulation and
optimization problems. It also poses new CAD problems that are similar to, but
more challenging, than the related problems in classical (non-quantum) CAD,
such as determining if two states or circuits are functionally equivalent.
While differences in classical states are easy to detect, quantum states, which
are represented by complex-valued vectors, exhibit subtle differences leading
to several notions of equivalence. This provides flexibility in optimizing
quantum circuits, but leads to difficult new equivalence-checking issues for
simulation and synthesis. We identify several different equivalence-checking
problems and present algorithms for practical benchmarks, including quantum
communication and search circuits, which are shown to be very fast and robust
for hundreds of qubits.

Joint Detection and Identification of an Unobservable Change in the Distribution of a Random Sequence

This paper examines the joint problem of detection and identification of a
sudden and unobservable change in the probability distribution function (pdf)
of a sequence of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random
variables to one of finitely many alternative pdf's. The objective is quick
detection of the change and accurate inference of the ensuing pdf. Following a
Bayesian approach, a new sequential decision strategy for this problem is
revealed and is proven optimal. Geometrical properties of this strategy are

Reliable Memories Built from Unreliable Components Based on Expander Graphs

Chilappagari,Shashi Kiran
Vasic,Bane

In this paper, memories built from components subject to transient faults are
considered. A fault-tolerant memory architecture based on low-density
parity-check codes is proposed and the existence of reliable memories for the
adversarial failure model is proved. The proof relies on the expansion property
of the underlying Tanner graph of the code. An equivalence between the
Taylor-Kuznetsov (TK) scheme and Gallager B algorithm is established and the
results are extended to the independent failure model. It is also shown that
the proposed memory architecture has lower redundancy compared to the TK
scheme. The results are illustrated with specific numerical examples.

An Energy Efficiency Perspective on Training for Fading Channels
2007-05-01

Gursoy,Mustafa Cenk

In this paper, the bit energy requirements of training-based transmission
over block Rayleigh fading channels are studied. Pilot signals are employed to
obtain the minimum mean-square-error (MMSE) estimate of the channel fading
coefficients. Energy efficiency is analyzed in the worst case scenario where
the channel estimate is assumed to be perfect and the error in the estimate is
considered as another source of additive Gaussian noise. It is shown that bit
energy requirement grows without bound as the snr goes to zero, and the minimum
bit energy is achieved at a nonzero snr value below which one should not
operate. The effect of the block length on both the minimum bit energy and the
snr value at which the minimum is achieved is investigated. Flash training
schemes are analyzed and shown to improve the energy efficiency in the low-snr
regime. Energy efficiency analysis is also carried out when peak power
constraints are imposed on pilot signals.

On the Low-SNR Capacity of Phase-Shift Keying with Hard-Decision Detection
2007-05-01

Gursoy,Mustafa Cenk

The low-snr capacity of M-ary PSK transmission over both the additive white
Gaussian noise (AWGN) and fading channels is analyzed when hard-decision
detection is employed at the receiver. Closed-form expressions for the first
and second derivatives of the capacity at zero snr are obtained. The
spectral-efficiency/bit-energy tradeoff in the low-snr regime is analyzed by
finding the wideband slope and the bit energy required at zero spectral
efficiency. Practical design guidelines are drawn from the
information-theoretic analysis. The fading channel analysis is conducted for
both coherent and noncoherent cases, and the performance penalty in the
low-power regime for not knowing the channel is identified.

Training Optimization for Gauss-Markov Rayleigh Fading Channels
2007-05-01

Akin,Sami
Gursoy,Mustafa Cenk

In this paper, pilot-assisted transmission over Gauss-Markov Rayleigh fading
channels is considered. A simple scenario, where a single pilot signal is
transmitted every T symbols and T-1 data symbols are transmitted in between the
pilots, is studied. First, it is assumed that binary phase-shift keying (BPSK)
modulation is employed at the transmitter. With this assumption, the training
period, and data and training power allocation are jointly optimized by
maximizing an achievable rate expression. Achievable rates and energy-per-bit
requirements are computed using the optimal training parameters. Secondly, a
capacity lower bound is obtained by considering the error in the estimate as
another source of additive Gaussian noise, and the training parameters are
optimized by maximizing this lower bound.

Performance Analysis for Multichannel Reception of OOFSK Signaling
2007-05-01

Wang,Qingyun
Gursoy,Mustafa Cenk

In this paper, the error performance of on-off frequency shift keying (OOFSK)
modulation over fading channels is analyzed when the receiver is equipped with
multiple antennas. The analysis is conducted in two cases: the coherent
scenario where the fading is perfectly known at the receiver, and the
noncoherent scenario where neither the receiver nor the transmitter knows the
fading coefficients. For both cases, the maximum a posteriori probability (MAP)
detection rule is derived and analytical probability of error expressions are
obtained. The effect of fading correlation among the receiver antennas is also
studied. Simulation results indicate that for sufficiently low duty cycle
values, lower probability of error values with respect to FSK signaling are
achieved. Equivalently, when compared to FSK modulation, OOFSK with low duty
cycle requires less energy to achieve the same probability of error, which
renders this modulation a more energy efficient transmission technique.

Error Probability Analysis of Peaky Signaling over Fading Channels
2007-05-01

Gursoy,Mustafa Cenk

In this paper, the performance of signaling strategies with high
peak-to-average power ratio is analyzed in both coherent and noncoherent fading
channels. Two recently proposed modulation schemes, namely on-off binary
phase-shift keying and on-off quaternary phase-shift keying, are considered.
For these modulation formats, the optimal decision rules used at the detector
are identified and analytical expressions for the error probabilities are
obtained. Numerical techniques are employed to compute the error probabilities.
It is concluded that increasing the peakedness of the signals results in
reduced error rates for a given power level and hence improve the energy
efficiency.

Using Images to create a Hierarchical Grid Spatial Index
2007-05-02

Machowski,Lukasz A.
Marwala,Tshilidzi

This paper presents a hybrid approach to spatial indexing of two dimensional
data. It sheds new light on the age old problem by thinking of the traditional
algorithms as working with images. Inspiration is drawn from an analogous
situation that is found in machine and human vision. Image processing
techniques are used to assist in the spatial indexing of the data. A fixed grid
approach is used and bins with too many records are sub-divided hierarchically.
Search queries are pre-computed for bins that do not contain any data records.
This has the effect of dividing the search space up into non rectangular
regions which are based on the spatial properties of the data. The bucketing
quad tree can be considered as an image with a resolution of two by two for
each layer. The results show that this method performs better than the quad
tree if there are more divisions per layer. This confirms our suspicions that
the algorithm works better if it gets to look at the data with higher
resolution images. An elegant class structure is developed where the
implementation of concrete spatial indexes for a particular data type merely
relies on rendering the data onto an image.

Power Allocation for Discrete-Input Non-Ergodic Block-Fading Channels

We consider power allocation algorithms for fixed-rate transmission over
Nakagami-m non-ergodic block-fading channels with perfect transmitter and
receiver channel state information and discrete input signal constellations
under both short- and long-term power constraints. Optimal power allocation
schemes are shown to be direct applications of previous results in the
literature. We show that the SNR exponent of the optimal short-term scheme is
given by the Singleton bound. We also illustrate the significant gains
available by employing long-term power constraints. Due to the nature of the
expressions involved, the complexity of optimal schemes may be prohibitive for
system implementation. We propose simple sub-optimal power allocation schemes
whose outage probability performance is very close to the minimum outage
probability obtained by optimal schemes.

More Efficient Algorithms and Analyses for Unequal Letter Cost Prefix-Free Coding
2007-05-02
2007-05-03
Golin,Mordecai
Jian,Li

There is a large literature devoted to the problem of finding an optimal
(min-cost) prefix-free code with an unequal letter-cost encoding alphabet of
size. While there is no known polynomial time algorithm for solving it
optimally there are many good heuristics that all provide additive errors to
optimal. The additive error in these algorithms usually depends linearly upon
the largest encoding letter size.
  This paper was motivated by the problem of finding optimal codes when the
encoding alphabet is infinite. Because the largest letter cost is infinite, the
previous analyses could give infinite error bounds. We provide a new algorithm
that works with infinite encoding alphabets. When restricted to the finite
alphabet case, our algorithm often provides better error bounds than the best
previous ones known.

statistics and the inter-object reference graph. They are quite elaborate.
However, they are also complex to implement and induce a high overhead. The
third clustering technique, called Detection & Reclustering of Objects (DRO),
is based on the same principles, but is much simpler to implement. These three
clustering algorithm have been implemented in the Texas persistent object store
and compared in terms of clustering efficiency (i.e., overall performance
increase) and overhead using the Object Clustering Benchmark (OCB). The results
obtained showed that DRO induced a lighter overhead while still achieving
better overall performance.

algorithm provides full performance in correcting a certain class of errors,
generic errors, which includes most errors, and can decode codes on algebraic
curves without the determination of unknown syndromes. Moreover, we propose
three different kinds of architectures that our algorithm can be applied to,
and we represent the control operation of shift-registers and switches at each
clock-timing with numerical simulations. We estimate the performance in
comparison of the total running time and the numbers of multipliers and
shift-registers in three architectures with those of the conventional ones for
codes on algebraic curves.

WDM and Directed Star Arboricity

A digraph is $m$-labelled if every arc is labelled by an integer in $\{1,
\dots,m\}$. Motivated by wavelength assignment for multicasts in optical
networks, we introduce and study $n$-fibre colourings of labelled digraphs.
These are colourings of the arcs of $D$ such that at each vertex $v$, and for
each colour $\alpha$, $in(v,\alpha)+out(v,\alpha)\leq n$ with $in(v,\alpha)$
the number of arcs coloured $\alpha$ entering $v$ and $out(v,\alpha)$ the
number of labels $l$ such that there is at least one arc of label $l$ leaving
$v$ and coloured with $\alpha$. The problem is to find the minimum number of
colours $\lambda_n(D)$ such that the $m$-labelled digraph $D$ has an $n$-fibre
colouring. In the particular case when $D$ is $1$-labelled, $\lambda_1(D)$ is
called the directed star arboricity of $D$, and is denoted by $dst(D)$. We
first show that $dst(D)\leq 2\Delta^-(D)+1$, and conjecture that if
$\Delta^-(D)\geq 2$, then $dst(D)\leq 2\Delta^-(D)$. We also prove that for a
subcubic digraph $D$, then $dst(D)\leq 3$, and that if $\Delta^+(D),
\Delta^-(D)\leq 2$, then $dst(D)\leq 4$. Finally, we study
$\lambda_n(m,k)=\max\{\lambda_n(D) \tq D \mbox{is $m$-labelled} \et
\Delta^-(D)\leq k\}$. We show that if $m\geq n$, then $\ds
\left\lceil\frac{m}{n}\left\lceil \frac{k}{n}\right\rceil + \frac{k}{n}
\right\rceil\leq \lambda_n(m,k) \leq\left\lceil\frac{m}{n}\left\lceil
\frac{k}{n}\right\rceil + \frac{k}{n} \right\rceil + C \frac{m^2\log k}{n}$ for
some constant $C$. We conjecture that the lower bound should be the right value
of $\lambda_n(m,k)$.

Edge casing is a well-known method to improve the readability of drawings of

Certain orders will lead to a more readable drawing than others. We formulate
several optimization criteria that try to capture the concept of a "good" cased
drawing. Further, we address the algorithmic question of how to turn a given
drawing into an optimal cased drawing. For many of the resulting optimization
problems, we either find polynomial time algorithms or NP-hardness results.

Undirected Graphs of Entanglement Two

Entanglement is a complexity measure of directed graphs that origins in fixed
point theory. This measure has shown its use in designing efficient algorithms
to verify logical properties of transition systems. We are interested in the
problem of deciding whether a graph has entanglement at most k. As this measure
is defined by means of games, game theoretic ideas naturally lead to design
polynomial algorithms that, for fixed k, decide the problem. Known
characterizations of directed graphs of entanglement at most 1 lead, for k = 1,
to design even faster algorithms. In this paper we present an explicit
characterization of undirected graphs of entanglement at most 2. With such a
characterization at hand, we devise a linear time algorithm to decide whether
an undirected graph has this property.

planar graphs with large girth, and outerplanar graphs, and relate this
parameter with several well-studied colourings, such as colouring of the

Encoding for the Blackwell Channel with Reinforced Belief Propagation
2007-05-03

Braunstein,A.
Kayhan,F.
Montorsi,G.
Zecchina,R.

A key idea in coding for the broadcast channel (BC) is binning, in which the
transmitter encode information by selecting a codeword from an appropriate bin
(the messages are thus the bin indexes). This selection is normally done by
solving an appropriate (possibly difficult) combinatorial problem. Recently it
has been shown that binning for the Blackwell channel --a particular BC-- can
be done by iterative schemes based on Survey Propagation (SP). This method uses
decimation for SP and suffers a complexity of O(n^2). In this paper we propose
a new variation of the Belief Propagation (BP) algorithm, named Reinforced BP
algorithm, that turns BP into a solver. Our simulations show that this new
algorithm has complexity O(n log n). Using this new algorithm together with a
non-linear coding scheme, we can efficiently achieve rates close to the border
of the capacity region of the Blackwell channel.

We study Batch Processor-Sharing (BPS) queuing model with hyper-exponential
service time distribution and Poisson batch arrival process. One of the main
goals to study BPS is the possibility of its application in size-based
scheduling, which is used in differentiation between Short and Long flows in
the Internet. In the case of hyper-exponential service time distribution we
find an analytical expression of the expected conditional response time for the
BPS queue. We show, that the expected conditional response time is a concave
function of the service time. We apply the received results to the Two Level
Processor-Sharing (TLPS) model with hyper-exponential service time distribution
and find the expression of the expected response time for the TLPS model. TLPS
scheduling discipline can be applied to size-based differentiation in TCP/IP
networks and Web server request handling.

We propose a new algorithm to the problem of polygonal curve approximation
based on a multiresolution approach. This algorithm is suboptimal but still
maintains some optimality between successive levels of resolution using dynamic
programming. We show theoretically and experimentally that this algorithm has a
linear complexity in time and space. We experimentally compare the outcomes of
our algorithm to the optimal "full search" dynamic programming solution and
finally to classical merge and split approaches. The experimental evaluations
confirm the theoretical derivations and show that the proposed approach
evaluated on 2D coastal maps either show a lower time complexity or provide
polygonal approximations closer to the input discrete curves.

generic discrete-event random simulation model, called VOODB, in order to
evaluate the performances of OODBs in general, and the performances of
optimization methods like clustering in particular. Such optimization methods
undoubtedly improve the performances of OODBs. Yet, they also always induce
some kind of overhead for the system. Therefore, it is important to evaluate
their exact impact on the overall performances. VOODB has been designed as a
generic discrete-event random simulation model by putting to use a modelling
approach, and has been validated by simulating the behavior of the O2 OODB and
the Texas persistent object store. Since our final objective is to compare
object clustering algorithms, some experiments have also been conducted on the
DSTC clustering technique, which is implemented in Texas. To validate VOODB,
performance results obtained by simulation for a given experiment have been
compared to the results obtained by benchmarking the real systems in the same
conditions. Benchmarking and simulation performance evaluations have been
observed to be consistent, so it appears that simulation can be a reliable
approach to evaluate the performances of OODBs.

OCB: A Generic Benchmark to Evaluate the Performances of Object-Oriented Database Systems
2007-05-03

Darmont,Jérôme
Petit,Bertrand
Schneider,Michel

We present in this paper a generic object-oriented benchmark (the Object
Clustering Benchmark) that has been designed to evaluate the performances of
clustering policies in object-oriented databases. OCB is generic because its
sample database may be customized to fit the databases introduced by the main
existing benchmarks (e.g., OO1). OCB's current form is clustering-oriented
because of its clustering-oriented workload, but it can be easily adapted to
other purposes. Lastly, OCB's code is compact and easily portable. OCB has been
implemented in a real system (Texas, running on a Sun workstation), in order to
test a specific clustering policy called DSTC. A few results concerning this
test are presented.

Performance Evaluation for Clustering Algorithms in Object-Oriented Database Systems
2007-05-03

Darmont,Jérôme
Attoui,Amar
Gourgand,Michel

It is widely acknowledged that good object clustering is critical to the
performance of object-oriented databases. However, object clustering always
involves some kind of overhead for the system. The aim of this paper is to
propose a modelling methodology in order to evaluate the performances of
different clustering policies. This methodology has been used to compare the
performances of three clustering algorithms found in the literature (Cactis, CK
and ORION) that we considered representative of the current research in the
field of object clustering. The actual performance evaluation was performed
using simulation. Simulation experiments we performed showed that the Cactis
algorithm is better than the ORION algorithm and that the CK algorithm totally
outperforms both other algorithms in terms of response time and clustering
overhead.

The Design of Efficiently-Encodable Rate-Compatible LDPC Codes
2007-05-03

Kim,Jaehong
Ramamoorthy,Aditya
McLaughlin,Steven W.

We present a new class of irregular low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes for
moderate block lengths (up to a few thousand bits) that are well-suited for
rate-compatible puncturing. The proposed codes show good performance under
puncturing over a wide range of rates and are suitable for usage in incremental
redundancy hybrid-automatic repeat request (ARQ) systems. In addition, these
codes are linear-time encodable with simple shift-register circuits. For a
block length of 1200 bits the codes outperform optimized irregular LDPC codes
and extended irregular repeat-accumulate (eIRA) codes for all puncturing rates
0.6~0.9 (base code performance is almost the same) and are particularly good at
high puncturing rates where good puncturing performance has been previously
difficult to achieve.

Succinct Indexable Dictionaries with Applications to Encoding $k$-ary Trees, Prefix Sums and Multisets
2007-05-04

Raman,Rajeev
Raman,Venkatesh
Satti,Srinivasa Rao

We consider the {\it indexable dictionary} problem, which consists of storing
a set $S \subseteq \{0,...,m-1\}$ for some integer $m$, while supporting the
operations of $\Rank(x)$, which returns the number of elements in $S$ that are
less than $x$ if $x \in S$, and -1 otherwise; and $\Select(i)$ which returns
the $i$-th smallest element in $S$. We give a data structure that supports both
operations in O(1) time on the RAM model and requires ${\cal B}(n,m) + o(n) +
O(\lg \lg m)$ bits to store a set of size $n$, where ${\cal B}(n,m) = \ceil{\lg
{m \choose n}}$ is the minimum number of bits required to store any $n$-element
subset from a universe of size $m$. Previous dictionaries taking this space
only supported (yes/no) membership queries in O(1) time. In the cell probe
model we can remove the $O(\lg \lg m)$ additive term in the space bound,
answering a question raised by Fich and Miltersen, and Pagh.
  We present extensions and applications of our indexable dictionary data
structure, including:
  An information-theoretically optimal representation of a $k$-ary cardinal
tree that supports standard operations in constant time,
  A representation of a multiset of size $n$ from $\{0,...,m-1\}$ in ${\cal
B}(n,m+n) + o(n)$ bits that supports (appropriate generalizations of) $\Rank$
and $\Select$ operations in constant time, and
  A representation of a sequence of $n$ non-negative integers summing up to $m$
in ${\cal B}(n,m+n) + o(n)$ bits that supports prefix sum queries in constant
time.

Iterative Rounding for the Closest String Problem
2007-05-03
2011-05-10
Chen,Jing-Chao

The closest string problem is an NP-hard problem, whose task is to find a
string that minimizes maximum Hamming distance to a given set of strings. This
can be reduced to an integer program (IP). However, to date, there exists no
known polynomial-time algorithm for IP. In 2004, Meneses et al. introduced a
branch-and-bound (B & B) method for solving the IP problem. Their algorithm is
not always efficient and has the exponential time complexity. In the paper, we
attempt to solve efficiently the IP problem by a greedy iterative rounding
technique. The proposed algorithm is polynomial time and much faster than the
existing B & B IP for the CSP. If the number of strings is limited to 3, the
algorithm is provably at most 1 away from the optimum. The empirical results
show that in many cases we can find an exact solution. Even though we fail to
find an exact solution, the solution found is very close to exact solution.

Rate Bounds for MIMO Relay Channels

Lo,Caleb K.
Vishwanath,Sriram
Heath,Robert W.

This paper considers the multi-input multi-output (MIMO) relay channel where
multiple antennas are employed by each terminal. Compared to single-input
single-output (SISO) relay channels, MIMO relay channels introduce additional
degrees of freedom, making the design and analysis of optimal cooperative
strategies more complex. In this paper, a partial cooperation strategy that
combines transmit-side message splitting and block-Markov encoding is
presented. Lower bounds on capacity that improve on a previously proposed
non-cooperative lower bound are derived for Gaussian MIMO relay channels.

Clustering Co-occurrence of Maximal Frequent Patterns in Streams
2007-05-04

de Graaf,Edgar H.
Kok,Joost N.
Kosters,Walter A.

One way of getting a better view of data is using frequent patterns. In this
paper frequent patterns are subsets that occur a minimal number of times in a
stream of itemsets. However, the discovery of frequent patterns in streams has
always been problematic. Because streams are potentially endless it is in
principle impossible to say if a pattern is often occurring or not. Furthermore
the number of patterns can be huge and a good overview of the structure of the
stream is lost quickly. The proposed approach will use clustering to facilitate
the analysis of the structure of the stream.
  A clustering on the co-occurrence of patterns will give the user an improved
view on the structure of the stream. Some patterns might occur so much together
that they should form a combined pattern. In this way the patterns in the
clustering will be the largest frequent patterns: maximal frequent patterns.
  Our approach to decide if patterns occur often together will be based on a
method of clustering when only the distance between pairs is known. The number
of maximal frequent patterns is much smaller and combined with clustering
methods these patterns provide a good view on the structure of the stream.

Clustering with Lattices in the Analysis of Graph Patterns
2007-05-04

de Graaf,Edgar H.
Kok,Joost N.
Kosters,Walter A.

Mining frequent subgraphs is an area of research where we have a given set of
graphs (each graph can be seen as a transaction), and we search for (connected)
subgraphs contained in many of these graphs. In this work we will discuss
techniques used in our framework Lattice2SAR for mining and analysing frequent
subgraph data and their corresponding lattice information. Lattice information
is provided by the graph mining algorithm gSpan; it contains all
supergraph-subgraph relations of the frequent subgraph patterns -- and their
supports.
  Lattice2SAR is in particular used in the analysis of frequent graph patterns
where the graphs are molecules and the frequent subgraphs are fragments. In the
analysis of fragments one is interested in the molecules where patterns occur.
This data can be very extensive and in this paper we focus on a technique of
making it better available by using the lattice information in our clustering.
Now we can reduce the number of times the highly compressed occurrence data
needs to be accessed by the user. The user does not have to browse all the
occurrence data in search of patterns occurring in the same molecules. Instead
one can directly see which frequent subgraphs are of interest.

NodeTrix: Hybrid Representation for Analyzing Social Networks
2007-05-04
2007-06-21
Henry,Nathalie
Fekete,Jean-Daniel
Mcguffin,Michael

The need to visualize large social networks is growing as hardware
capabilities make analyzing large networks feasible and many new data sets
become available. Unfortunately, the visualizations in existing systems do not
satisfactorily answer the basic dilemma of being readable both for the global
structure of the network and also for detailed analysis of local communities.
To address this problem, we present NodeTrix, a hybrid representation for
networks that combines the advantages of two traditional representations:
node-link diagrams are used to show the global structure of a network, while
arbitrary portions of the network can be shown as adjacency matrices to better
support the analysis of communities. A key contribution is a set of interaction
techniques. These allow analysts to create a NodeTrix visualization by dragging
selections from either a node-link or a matrix, flexibly manipulate the
NodeTrix representation to explore the dataset, and create meaningful summary
visualizations of their findings. Finally, we present a case study applying
NodeTrix to the analysis of the InfoVis 2004 coauthorship dataset to illustrate
the capabilities of NodeTrix as both an exploration tool and an effective means
of communicating results.

Risk Assessment Algorithms Based On Recursive Neural Networks
2007-05-04

De Lara,Alejandro Chinea Manrique
Parent,Michel

The assessment of highly-risky situations at road intersections have been
recently revealed as an important research topic within the context of the
automotive industry. In this paper we shall introduce a novel approach to
compute risk functions by using a combination of a highly non-linear processing
model in conjunction with a powerful information encoding procedure.
Specifically, the elements of information either static or dynamic that appear
in a road intersection scene are encoded by using directed positional acyclic
labeled graphs. The risk assessment problem is then reformulated in terms of an
inductive learning task carried out by a recursive neural network. Recursive
neural networks are connectionist models capable of solving supervised and
non-supervised learning problems represented by directed ordered acyclic
graphs. The potential of this novel approach is demonstrated through well
predefined scenarios. The major difference of our approach compared to others
is expressed by the fact of learning the structure of the risk. Furthermore,
the combination of a rich information encoding procedure with a generalized
model of dynamical recurrent networks permit us, as we shall demonstrate, a
sophisticated processing of information that we believe as being a first step
for building future advanced intersection safety systems

Privacy - an Issue for eLearning? A Trend Analysis Reflecting the Attitude of European eLearning Users
2007-05-04

Borcea-Pfitzmann,Katrin
Stange,Anne-Katrin

Availing services provided via the Internet became a widely accepted means in
organising one's life. Beside others, eLearning goes with this trend as well.
But, while employing Internet service makes life more convenient, at the same
time, it raises risks with respect to the protection of the users' privacy.
This paper analyses the attitudes of eLearning users towards their privacy by,
initially, pointing out terminology and legal issues connected with privacy.
Further, the concept and implementation as well as a result analysis of a
conducted study is presented, which explores the problem area from different
perspectives. The paper will show that eLearning users indeed care for the
protection of their personal information when using eLearning services.
However, their attitudes and behaviour slightly differ. In conclusion, we
provide first approaches of assisting possibilities for users how to resolve
the difference of requirements and their actual activities with respect to
privacy protection.

Learning to Bluff
2007-05-07

Hurwitz,Evan
Marwala,Tshilidzi

The act of bluffing confounds game designers to this day. The very nature of
bluffing is even open for debate, adding further complication to the process of
creating intelligent virtual players that can bluff, and hence play,
realistically. Through the use of intelligent, learning agents, and carefully
designed agent outlooks, an agent can in fact learn to predict its opponents
reactions based not only on its own cards, but on the actions of those around
it. With this wider scope of understanding, an agent can in learn to bluff its
opponents, with the action representing not an illogical action, as bluffing is
often viewed, but rather as an act of maximising returns through an effective
statistical optimisation. By using a tee dee lambda learning algorithm to
continuously adapt neural network agent intelligence, agents have been shown to
be able to learn to bluff without outside prompting, and even to learn to call
each others bluffs in free, competitive play.

Soft constraint abstraction based on semiring homomorphism
2007-05-05

Li,Sanjiang
Ying,Mingsheng

The semiring-based constraint satisfaction problems (semiring CSPs), proposed
by Bistarelli, Montanari and Rossi \cite{BMR97}, is a very general framework of
soft constraints. In this paper we propose an abstraction scheme for soft
constraints that uses semiring homomorphism. To find optimal solutions of the
concrete problem, the idea is, first working in the abstract problem and
finding its optimal solutions, then using them to solve the concrete problem.
  In particular, we show that a mapping preserves optimal solutions if and only
if it is an order-reflecting semiring homomorphism. Moreover, for a semiring
homomorphism $\alpha$ and a problem $P$ over $S$, if $t$ is optimal in
$\alpha(P)$, then there is an optimal solution $\bar{t}$ of $P$ such that
$\bar{t}$ has the same value as $t$ in $\alpha(P)$.

The Optimization of a Novel Prismatic Drive

Chablat,Damien
Caro,Stéphane
Bouyer,Emilie

The design of a mechanical transmission taking into account the transmitted
forces is reported in this paper. This transmission is based on Slide-o-Cam, a
cam mechanism with multiple rollers mounted on a common translating follower.
The design of Slide-o-Cam, a transmission intended to produce a sliding motion
from a turning drive, or vice versa, was reported elsewhere. This transmission
provides pure-rolling motion, thereby reducing the friction of rack-and-pinions
and linear drives. The pressure angle is a relevant performance index for this
transmission because it determines the amount of force transmitted to the load
vs. that transmitted to the machine frame. To assess the transmission
capability of the mechanism, the Hertz formula is introduced to calculate the
stresses on the rollers and on the cams. The final transmission is intended to
replace the current ball-screws in the Orthoglide, a three-DOF parallel robot
for the production of translational motions, currently under development for
machining applications at Ecole Centrale de Nantes.

Equivalence of LP Relaxation and Max-Product for Weighted Matching in General Graphs
2007-05-05

Sanghavi,Sujay

Max-product belief propagation is a local, iterative algorithm to find the
mode/MAP estimate of a probability distribution. While it has been successfully
employed in a wide variety of applications, there are relatively few
theoretical guarantees of convergence and correctness for general loopy graphs
that may have many short cycles. Of these, even fewer provide exact ``necessary
and sufficient'' characterizations.
  In this paper we investigate the problem of using max-product to find the
maximum weight matching in an arbitrary graph with edge weights. This is done
by first constructing a probability distribution whose mode corresponds to the
optimal matching, and then running max-product. Weighted matching can also be
posed as an integer program, for which there is an LP relaxation. This
relaxation is not always tight. In this paper we show that \begin{enumerate}
\item If the LP relaxation is tight, then max-product always converges, and
that too to the correct answer. \item If the LP relaxation is loose, then
max-product does not converge. \end{enumerate} This provides an exact,
data-dependent characterization of max-product performance, and a precise
connection to LP relaxation, which is a well-studied optimization technique.
Also, since LP relaxation is known to be tight for bipartite graphs, our
results generalize other recent results on using max-product to find weighted
matchings in bipartite graphs.

Medical Image Segmentation and Localization using Deformable Templates

Spiller,Jonathan M.
Marwala,T.

This paper presents deformable templates as a tool for segmentation and
localization of biological structures in medical images. Structures are
represented by a prototype template, combined with a parametric warp mapping
used to deform the original shape. The localization procedure is achieved using
a multi-stage, multi-resolution algorithm de-signed to reduce computational
complexity and time. The algorithm initially identifies regions in the image
most likely to contain the desired objects and then examines these regions at
progressively increasing resolutions. The final stage of the algorithm involves
warping the prototype template to match the localized objects. The algorithm is
presented along with the results of four example applications using MRI, x-ray
and ultrasound images.

Non-cooperative games for spreading code optimization, power control and receiver design in wireless data networks
2007-05-06

Buzzi,Stefano
Poor,H. Vincent

This paper focuses on the issue of energy efficiency in wireless data
networks through a game theoretic approach. The case considered is that in
which each user is allowed to vary its transmit power, spreading code, and
uplink receiver in order to maximize its own utility, which is here defined as
the ratio of data throughput to transmit power. In particular, the case in
which linear multiuser detectors are employed at the receiver is treated first,
and, then, the more challenging case in which non-linear decision feedback
multiuser receivers are adopted is addressed. It is shown that, for both
receivers, the problem at hand of utility maximization can be regarded as a
non-cooperative game, and it is proved that a unique Nash equilibrium point
exists. Simulation results show that significant performance gains can be
obtained through both non-linear processing and spreading code optimization; in
particular, for systems with a number of users not larger than the processing
gain, remarkable gains come from spreading code optimization, while, for
overloaded systems, the largest gainscome from the use of non-linear
processing. In every case, however, the non-cooperative games proposed here are
shown to outperform competing alternatives.

Enhancement of Noisy Planar Nuclear Medicine Images using Mean Field Annealing

Falk,D. L.
Rubin,D. M.
Marwala,T.

Nuclear medicine (NM) images inherently suffer from large amounts of noise
and blur. The purpose of this research is to reduce the noise and blur while
maintaining image integrity for improved diagnosis. The proposed solution is to
increase image quality after the standard pre- and post-processing undertaken
by a gamma camera system. Mean Field Annealing (MFA) is the image processing
technique used in this research. It is a computational iterative technique that
makes use of the Point Spread Function (PSF) and the noise associated with the
NM image. MFA is applied to NM images with the objective of reducing noise
while not compromising edge integrity. Using a sharpening filter as a
post-processing technique (after MFA) yields image enhancement of planar NM
images.

on three objective functions: (i) the pressure angle, which is a suitable
performance index for the transmission because it determines the amount of
force transmitted to the load vs. that transmitted to the machine frame; (ii)
the Hertz pressure used to evaluate the stresses produced on the contact
surface between cam and roller; and (iii) the size of the mechanism,

Game-Theoretic Power Control in Impulse Radio UWB Wireless Networks

Poor,H. Vincent

In this paper, a game-theoretic model for studying power control for wireless
data networks in frequency-selective multipath environments is analyzed. The
uplink of an impulse-radio ultrawideband system is considered. The effects of
self-interference and multiple-access interference on the performance of Rake
receivers are investigated for synchronous systems. Focusing on energy
efficiency, a noncooperative game is proposed in which users in the network are
allowed to choose their transmit powers to maximize their own utilities, and
the Nash equilibrium for the proposed game is derived. It is shown that, due to
the frequency selective multipath, the noncooperative solution is achieved at
different signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratios, respectively of the channel
realization. A large-system analysis is performed to derive explicit
expressions for the achieved utilities. The Pareto-optimal (cooperative)
solution is also discussed and compared with the noncooperative approach.

Satisfiability Parsimoniously Reduces to the Tantrix(TM) Rotation Puzzle Problem

Holzer and Holzer (Discrete Applied Mathematics 144(3):345--358, 2004) proved
that the Tantrix(TM) rotation puzzle problem is NP-complete. They also showed
that for infinite rotation puzzles, this problem becomes undecidable. We study
the counting version and the unique version of this problem. We prove that the
satisfiability problem parsimoniously reduces to the Tantrix(TM) rotation
puzzle problem. In particular, this reduction preserves the uniqueness of the
solution, which implies that the unique Tantrix(TM) rotation puzzle problem is
as hard as the unique satisfiability problem, and so is DP-complete under
polynomial-time randomized reductions, where DP is the second level of the
boolean hierarchy over NP.

Variable-Rate Distributed Source Coding in the Presence of Byzantine Sensors
2007-05-07

Kosut,Oliver
Tong,Lang

The distributed source coding problem is considered when the sensors, or
encoders, are under Byzantine attack; that is, an unknown number of sensors
have been reprogrammed by a malicious intruder to undermine the reconstruction
at the fusion center. Three different forms of the problem are considered. The
first is a variable-rate setup, in which the decoder adaptively chooses the
rates at which the sensors transmit. An explicit characterization of the
variable-rate minimum achievable sum rate is stated, given by the maximum
entropy over the set of distributions indistinguishable from the true source
distribution by the decoder. In addition, two forms of the fixed-rate problem
are considered, one with deterministic coding and one with randomized coding.
The achievable rate regions are given for both these problems, with a larger
region achievable using randomized coding, though both are suboptimal compared
to variable-rate coding.

Performance Comparison of Energy-Efficient Power Control for CDMA and Multiuser UWB Networks
2007-05-07

Bacci,Giacomo

Poor,H. Vincent

This paper studies the performance of a wireless data network using
energy-efficient power control techniques when different multiple access
schemes, namely direct-sequence code division multiple access (DS-CDMA) and
impulse-radio ultrawideband (IR-UWB), are considered. Due to the large
bandwidth of the system, the multipath channel is assumed to be
frequency-selective. By making use of noncooperative game-theoretic models and
large-system analysis tools, explicit expressions for the achieved utilities at
the Nash equilibrium are derived in terms of the network parameters. A measure
of the loss of DS-CDMA with respect to IR-UWB is proposed, which proves
substantial equivalence between the two schemes. Simulation results are
provided to validate the analysis.

statistical decisiveness among the intra and interclass comparisons. The best
categorical algorithms are then incorporated into a hybrid methodology, where
the advantageous effects of fusion strategies are considered.

On Isotropic Sets of Points in the Plane. Application to the Design of Robot Archirectures
2007-05-07

Angeles,Jorge
Chablat,Damien

Various performance indices are used for the design of serial manipulators.
One method of optimization relies on the condition number of the Jacobian
matrix. The minimization of the condition number leads, under certain
conditions, to isotropic configurations, for which the roundoff-error
amplification is lowest. In this paper, the isotropy conditions, introduced
elsewhere, are the motivation behind the introduction of isotropic sets of
points. By connecting together these points, we define families of isotropic
manipulators. This paper is devoted to planar manipulators, the concepts being
currently extended to their spatial counterparts. Furthermore, only
manipulators with revolute joints are considered here.

The Kinematic Analysis of a Symmetrical Three-Degree-of-Freedom Planar Parallel Manipulator
2007-05-07

Chablat,Damien
Wenger,Philippe

Presented in this paper is the kinematic analysis of a symmetrical
three-degree-of-freedom planar parallel manipulator. In opposite to serial
manipulators, parallel manipulators can admit not only multiple inverse
kinematic solutions, but also multiple direct kinematic solutions. This
property produces more complicated kinematic models but allows more flexibility
in trajectory planning. To take into account this property, the notion of
aspects, i.e. the maximal singularity-free domains, was introduced, based on
the notion of working modes, which makes it possible to separate the inverse
kinematic solutions. The aim of this paper is to show that a non-singular
assembly-mode changing trajectory exist for a symmetrical planar parallel
manipulator, with equilateral base and platform triangle.

Uniqueness Domains in the Workspace of Parallel Manipulators
2007-05-07

Wenger,Philippe
Chablat,Damien

This work investigates new kinematic features of parallel manipulators. It is
well known that parallel manipulators admit generally several direct kinematic
solutions for a given set of input joint values. The aim of this paper is to
characterize the uniqueness domains in the workspace of parallel manipulators,
as well as their image in the joint space. The study focuses on the most usual
case of parallel manipulators with only one inverse kinematic solution. The
notion of aspect introduced for serial manipulators in [Borrel 86] is redefined
for such parallel manipulators. Then, it is shown that it is possible to link
several solutions to the forward kinematic problem without meeting a
singularity, thus meaning that the aspects are not uniqueness domains. An
additional set of surfaces, namely the characteristic surfaces, are
characterized which divide the workspace into basic regions and yield new
uniqueness domains. This study is illustrated all along the paper with a 3-RPR
planar parallel manipulator. An octree model of spaces is used to compute the
joint space, the workspace and all other newly defined sets.

The Kinematic design of a 3-dof Hybrid Manipulator
2007-05-07

Chablat,Damien
Wenger,Philippe
Angeles,Jorge

This paper focuses on the kinematic properties of a new
three-degree-of-freedom hybrid manipulator. This manipulator is obtained by
adding in series to a five-bar planar mechanism (similar to the one studied by
Bajpai and Roth) a third revolute passing through the line of centers of the
two actuated revolute joints of the above linkage. The resulting architecture
is hybrid in that it has both serial and parallel links. Fully-parallel
manipulators are known for the existence of particularly undesirable
singularities (referred to as parallel singularities) where control is lost [4]
and [6]. On the other hand, due to their cantilever type of kinematic
arrangement, fully serial manipulators suffer from a lack of stiffness and from
relatively large positioning errors. The hybrid manipulator studied is
intrinsically stiffer and more accurate. Furthermore, since all actuators are
located on the first axis, the inertial effects are considerably reduced. In
addition, it is shown that the special kinematic structure of our manipulator
has the potential of avoiding parallel singularities by a suitable choice of
the "working mode", thus leading to larger workspaces. The influence of the
different structural dimensions (e.g. the link lengths) on the kinematic and
mechanical properties are analysed in view of the optimal design of such hybrid
manipulators.

Improved Analysis of Kannan's Shortest Lattice Vector Algorithm
2007-05-07
2007-05-09
Hanrot,Guillaume
Stehlé,Damien

The security of lattice-based cryptosystems such as NTRU, GGH and Ajtai-Dwork
essentially relies upon the intractability of computing a shortest non-zero
lattice vector and a closest lattice vector to a given target vector in high
dimensions. The best algorithms for these tasks are due to Kannan, and, though
remarkably simple, their complexity estimates have not been improved since more
than twenty years. Kannan's algorithm for solving the shortest vector problem
is in particular crucial in Schnorr's celebrated block reduction algorithm, on
which are based the best known attacks against the lattice-based encryption
schemes mentioned above. Understanding precisely Kannan's algorithm is of prime
importance for providing meaningful key-sizes. In this paper we improve the
complexity analyses of Kannan's algorithms and discuss the possibility of
improving the underlying enumeration strategy.

Artificial Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines for Water Demand Time Series Forecasting
2007-05-07

Msiza,Ishmael S.

Marwala,Tshilidzi

Water plays a pivotal role in many physical processes, and most importantly
in sustaining human life, animal life and plant life. Water supply entities
therefore have the responsibility to supply clean and safe water at the rate
required by the consumer. It is therefore necessary to implement mechanisms and
systems that can be employed to predict both short-term and long-term water
demands. The increasingly growing field of computational intelligence
techniques has been proposed as an efficient tool in the modelling of dynamic
phenomena. The primary objective of this paper is to compare the efficiency of
two computational intelligence techniques in water demand forecasting. The
techniques under comparison are the Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and the
Support Vector Machines (SVMs). In this study it was observed that the ANNs
perform better than the SVMs. This performance is measured against the
generalisation ability of the two.

A New Three-DOF Parallel Mechanism: Milling Machine Applications
2007-05-07

Chablat,Damien
Wenger,Philippe

This paper describes a new parallel kinematic architecture for machining
applications, namely, the orthoglide. This machine features three fixed
parallel linear joints which are mounted orthogonally and a mobile platform
which moves in the Cartesian x-y-z space with fixed orientation. The main
interest of the orthoglide is that it takes benefit from the advantages of the
popular PPP serial machines (regular Cartesian workspace shape and uniform
performances) as well as from the parallel kinematic arrangement of the links
(less inertia and better dynamic performances), which makes the orthoglide well
suited to high-speed machining applications. Possible extension of the
orthoglide to 5-axis machining is also investigated.

Cellular Systems with Full-Duplex Amplify-and-Forward Relaying and Cooperative Base-Stations
2007-05-07

Somekh,Oren
Simeone,Osvaldo
Poor,H. Vincent
Shamai,Shlomo

In this paper the benefits provided by multi-cell processing of signals
transmitted by mobile terminals which are received via dedicated relay
terminals (RTs) are assessed. Unlike previous works, each RT is assumed here to
be capable of full-duplex operation and receives the transmission of adjacent
relay terminals. Focusing on intra-cell TDMA and non-fading channels, a
simplified uplink cellular model introduced by Wyner is considered. This
framework facilitates analytical derivation of the per-cell sum-rate of
multi-cell and conventional single-cell receivers. In particular, the analysis
is based on the observation that the signal received at the base stations can
be interpreted as the outcome of a two-dimensional linear time invariant
system. Numerical results are provided as well in order to provide further
insight into the performance benefits of multi-cell processing with relaying.

Tracking User Attention in Collaborative Tagging Communities
2007-05-07

Santos-Neto,Elizeu
Ripeanu,Matei
Iamnitchi,Adriana

Collaborative tagging has recently attracted the attention of both industry
and academia due to the popularity of content-sharing systems such as
CiteULike, del.icio.us, and Flickr. These systems give users the opportunity to
add data items and to attach their own metadata (or tags) to stored data. The
result is an effective content management tool for individual users. Recent
studies, however, suggest that, as tagging communities grow, the added content
and the metadata become harder to manage due to an ease in content diversity.
Thus, mechanisms that cope with increase of diversity are fundamental to
improve the scalability and usability of collaborative tagging systems. This
paper analyzes whether usage patterns can be harnessed to improve navigability
in a growing knowledge space. To this end, it presents a characterization of
two collaborative tagging communities that target scientific literature:
CiteULike and Bibsonomy. We explore three main directions: First, we analyze
the tagging activity distribution across the user population. Second, we define
new metrics for similarity in user interest and use these metrics to uncover
the structure of the tagging communities we study. The structure we uncover
suggests a clear segmentation of interests into a large number of individuals
with unique preferences and a core set of users with interspersed interests.
Finally, we offer preliminary results that demonstrate that the interest-based
structure of the tagging community can be used to facilitate content usage as
communities scale.

Fuzzy Artmap and Neural Network Approach to Online Processing of Inputs with Missing Values
2007-05-08

Nelwamondo,F. V.
Marwala,T.

An ensemble based approach for dealing with missing data, without predicting
or imputing the missing values is proposed. This technique is suitable for
online operations of neural networks and as a result, is used for online
condition monitoring. The proposed technique is tested in both classification
and regression problems. An ensemble of Fuzzy-ARTMAPs is used for
classification whereas an ensemble of multi-layer perceptrons is used for the
regression problem. Results obtained using this ensemble-based technique are
compared to those obtained using a combination of auto-associative neural
networks and genetic algorithms and findings show that this method can perform
up to 9% better in regression problems. Another advantage of the proposed
technique is that it eliminates the need for finding the best estimate of the
data, and hence, saves time.

Optimal Cache-Oblivious Mesh Layouts
2007-05-08
2009-10-05
Bender,Michael A.
Kuszmaul,Bradley C.
Teng,Shang-Hua
Wang,Kebin

A mesh is a graph that divides physical space into regularly-shaped regions.
Meshes computations form the basis of many applications, e.g. finite-element
methods, image rendering, and collision detection. In one important mesh
primitive, called a mesh update, each mesh vertex stores a value and repeatedly
updates this value based on the values stored in all neighboring vertices. The
performance of a mesh update depends on the layout of the mesh in memory.
  This paper shows how to find a memory layout that guarantees that the mesh
update has asymptotically optimal memory performance for any set of memory
parameters. Such a memory layout is called cache-oblivious. Formally, for a
$d$-dimensional mesh $G$, block size $B$, and cache size $M$ (where
$M=\Omega(B^d)$), the mesh update of $G$ uses $O(1+|G|/B)$ memory transfers.
The paper also shows how the mesh-update performance degrades for smaller
caches, where $M=o(B^d)$.
  The paper then gives two algorithms for finding cache-oblivious mesh layouts.
The first layout algorithm runs in time $O(|G|\log^2|G|)$ both in expectation
and with high probability on a RAM. It uses $O(1+|G|\log^2(|G|/M)/B)$ memory
transfers in expectation and $O(1+(|G|/B)(\log^2(|G|/M) + \log|G|))$ memory
transfers with high probability in the cache-oblivious and disk-access machine
(DAM) models. The layout is obtained by finding a fully balanced decomposition
tree of $G$ and then performing an in-order traversal of the leaves of the
tree. The second algorithm runs faster by almost a $\log|G|/\log\log|G|$ factor
in all three memory models, both in expectation and with high probability. The
layout obtained by finding a relax-balanced decomposition tree of $G$ and then
performing an in-order traversal of the leaves of the tree.

Strategies for the Design of a Slide-o-Cam Transmission
2007-05-08

Chablat,Damien
Angeles,Jorge

The optimization of the pressure angle in a cam-follower transmission is
reported in this paper. This transmission is based on Slide-o-Cam, a cam
mechanism with multiple rollers mounted on a common translating follower. The
design of Slide-o-Cam, a transmission intended to produce a sliding motion from
a turning drive, or vice versa, was reported elsewhere. This transmission
provides pure-rolling motion, thereby reducing the friction of rack-and-pinions
and linear drives. The pressure angle is a suitable performance index for this
transmission because it determines the amount of force transmitted to the load
vs. that transmitted to the machine frame. Two alternative design strategies
are studied, namely, (i) increase the number of lobes on each cam or (ii)
increase the number of cams. This device is intended to replace the current
ball-screws in Orthoglide, a three-DOF parallel robot for the production of
translational motions, currently under development at Ecole Centrale de Nantes
for machining applications.

The goal of this paper is to define the n-connected regions in the Cartesian
workspace of fully-parallel manipulators, i.e. the maximal regions where it is
possible to execute point-to-point motions. The manipulators considered in this
study may have multiple direct and inverse kinematic solutions. The N-connected
regions are characterized by projection, onto the Cartesian workspace, of the
connected components of the reachable configuration space defined in the
Cartesian product of the Cartesian space by the joint space. Generalized octree
models are used for the construction of all spaces. This study is illustrated
with a simple planar fully-parallel manipulator.

The Design of Parallel Kinematic Machine Tools Using Kinetostatic Performance Criteria
2007-05-08

Majou,Félix
Wenger,Philippe
Chablat,Damien

Most industrial machine tools have a serial kinematic architecture, which
means that each axis has to carry the following one, including its actuators
and joints. High Speed Machining highlights some drawbacks of such
architectures: heavy moving parts require from the machine structure high
stiffness to limit bending problems that lower the machine accuracy, and limit
the dynamic performances of the feed axes. That is why PKMs attract more and
more researchers and companies, because they are claimed to offer several
advantages over their serial counterparts, like high structural rigidity and
high dynamic capacities. Indeed, the parallel kinematic arrangement of the
links provides higher stiffness and lower moving masses that reduce inertia
effects. Thus, PKMs have better dynamic performances. However, the design of a
parallel kinematic machine tool (PKMT) is a hard task that requires further
research studies before wide industrial use can be expected. Many criteria need
to be taken into account in the design of a PKMT. We pay special attention to
the description of kinetostatic criteria that rely on the conditioning of the
Jacobian matrix of the mechanism. The organisation of this paper is as follows:
next section introduces general remarks about PKMs, then is explained why PKMs
can be interesting alternative machine tool designs. Then are presented
existing PKMTs. An application to the design of a small-scale machine tool
prototype developed at IRCCyN is presented at the end of this paper.

Mining Patterns with a Balanced Interval
2007-05-08

Kosters,Edgar de Graaf Joost Kok Walter

In many applications it will be useful to know those patterns that occur with
a balanced interval, e.g., a certain combination of phone numbers are called
almost every Friday or a group of products are sold a lot on Tuesday and
Thursday.
  In previous work we proposed a new measure of support (the number of
occurrences of a pattern in a dataset), where we count the number of times a
pattern occurs (nearly) in the middle between two other occurrences. If the
number of non-occurrences between two occurrences of a pattern stays almost the
same then we call the pattern balanced.
  It was noticed that some very frequent patterns obviously also occur with a
balanced interval, meaning in every transaction. However more interesting
patterns might occur, e.g., every three transactions. Here we discuss a
solution using standard deviation and average. Furthermore we propose a simpler
approach for pruning patterns with a balanced interval, making estimating the
pruning threshold more intuitive.

This article provides a formalism making it possible to manage the solutions

We introduce the concept of working modes to separate the solutions from the
opposite geometrical model. Then, we define, for each working mode, the aspects
of these manipulators. To separate the solutions from the direct kinematics
model, we introduce the concept of characteristic surfaces. Then, we define the
uniqueness domains, as being the greatest domains of the workspace in which
there is unicity of solutions. The principal applications of this work are the
design, the trajectory planning.

evaluation. Applications of the index fall in the realm of design, but control
applications are outlined. The paper focuses on planar manipulators, the basic

phase in which the receivers estimate the fading coefficients of their

decode-and-forward relaying schemes are considered, and the corresponding
achievable rate expressions are obtained. The achievable rate expressions are

Ordering Finite-State Markov Channels by Mutual Information

Eckford,Andrew W.

In previous work, an ordering result was given for the symbolwise probability
of error using general Markov channels, under iterative decoding of LDPC codes.
In this paper, the ordering result is extended to mutual information, under the
assumption of an iid input distribution. For certain channels, in which the
capacity-achieving input distribution is iid, this allows ordering of the
channels by capacity. The complexity of analyzing general Markov channels is
mitigated by this ordering, since it is possible to immediately determine that
a wide class of channels, with different numbers of states, has a smaller
mutual information than a given channel.

Multiple Antenna Secure Broadcast over Wireless Networks

Liu,Ruoheng
Poor,H. Vincent

In wireless data networks, communication is particularly susceptible to
eavesdropping due to its broadcast nature. Security and privacy systems have
become critical for wireless providers and enterprise networks. This paper
considers the problem of secret communication over the Gaussian broadcast
channel, where a multi-antenna transmitter sends independent confidential
messages to two users with perfect secrecy. That is, each user would like to
obtain its own message reliably and confidentially. First, a computable
Sato-type outer bound on the secrecy capacity region is provided for a
multi-antenna broadcast channel with confidential messages. Next, a dirty-paper
secure coding scheme and its simplified version are described. For each case,
the corresponding achievable rate region is derived under the perfect secrecy
requirement. Finally, two numerical examples demonstrate that the Sato-type
outer bound is consistent with the boundary of the simplified dirty-paper
coding secrecy rate region.

for some of them. Applications of the results are discussed, which include
optimum power allocation in spatial multiplexing systems, optimum power/time

interstate interactions, which result on either peace or conflict. Effective
prediction of the possibility of conflict between states is an important
decision support tool for policy makers. In a previous research, neural
networks (NNs) have been implemented to predict the MID. Support Vector
Machines (SVMs) have proven to be very good prediction techniques and are

relevant leg location while the manipulator moves the TCP along the Cartesian
axes. Using the measured differences, the developed algorithm estimates the
joint offsets that are treated as the most essential parameters to be adjusted.

Rate Adaptation for Cognitive Radio under Interference from Primary Spectrum User
2007-05-09

Popovski,Petar
Yomo,Hiroyuki
Nishimori,Kentaro
Di Taranto,Rocco

A cognitive radio can operate as a secondary system in a given spectrum. This
operation should use limited power in order not to disturb the communication by
primary spectrum user. Under such conditions, in this paper we investigate how
to maximize the spectral efficiency in the secondary system. A secondary
receiver observes a multiple access channel of two users, the secondary and the
primary transmitter, respectively. We show that, for spectrally-efficient
operation, the secondary system should apply Opportunistic Interference
Cancellation (OIC). With OIC, the secondary system decodes the primary signal
when such an opportunity is created by the primary rate and the power received
from the primary system. For such an operation, we derive the achievable data
rate in the secondary system. When the primary signal is decodable, we devise a
method, based on superposition coding, by which the secondary system can
achieve the maximal possible rate. Finally, we investigate the power allocation
in the secondary system when multiple channels are used. We show that the
optimal power allocation with OIC can be achieved through intercepted
water-filling instead of the conventional water-filling. The results show a
significant gain for the rate achieved through an opportunistic interference
cancellation.

set of elementary behavior, and evolution is given the goal of assembling them
to solve complex tasks. Two experiments are presented, demonstrating the
efficiency and showing the recursiveness of this approach. In particular, the
sensitivity with respect to the proposed elementary behaviors, and the
robustness w.r.t. generalization of the resulting controllers are studied in

"direct kinematics" matrices. The singular configurations of these matrices are

this method: the common desired properties are the largest square Cartesian
workspace for given kinetostatic performances. The orientation and position of
the Cartesian workspace are chosen to avoid singularities and to produce the
best ratio between Cartesian workspace size and mechanism size. The machine
size of each resulting design is used as a comparative criterion.

2007-05-09

Wenger,Philippe
Chablat,Damien

The orthoglide is a 3-DOF parallel mechanism designed at IRCCyN for machining
applications. It features three fixed parallel linear joints which are mounted
orthogonally and a mobile platform which moves in the Cartesian x-y-z space
with fixed orientation. The orthoglide has been designed as function of a
prescribed Cartesian workspace with prescribed kinetostatic performances. The
interesting features of the orthoglide are a regular Cartesian workspace shape,
uniform performances in all directions and good compactness. A small-scale
prototype of the orthoglide under development is presented at the end of this
paper.

This paper presents the development of a new software in order to manage
objects, robots and mannequins in using the possibilities given by the haptic
feedback of the Phantom desktop devices. The haptic device provides 6
positional degree of freedom sensing but three degrees force feedback. This
software called eM-Virtual Desktop is integrated in the Tecnomatix's solution
called eM-Workplace. The eM-Workplace provides powerful solutions for planning
and designing of complex assembly facilities, lines and workplaces. In the
digital mockup context, the haptic interfaces can be used to reduce the
development cycle of products. Three different loops are used to manage the
graphic, the collision detection and the haptic feedback according to theirs
own frequencies. The developed software is currently tested in industrial
context by a European automotive constructor.

Predicting the Presence of Internet Worms using Novelty Detection
2007-05-09

Marais,E.
Marwala,T.

Internet worms cause billions of dollars in damage yearly, affecting millions
of users worldwide. For countermeasures to be deployed timeously, it is
necessary to use an automated system to detect the spread of a worm. This paper
discusses a method of determining the presence of a worm, based on routing
information currently available from Internet routers. An autoencoder, which is
a specialized type of neural network, was used to detect anomalies in normal
routing behavior. The autoencoder was trained using information from a single
router, and was able to detect both global instability caused by worms as well
as localized routing instability.

Robust Multi-Cellular Developmental Design
2007-05-09

Devert,Alexandre
Bredèche,Nicolas
Schoenauer,Marc

This paper introduces a continuous model for Multi-cellular Developmental
Design. The cells are fixed on a 2D grid and exchange "chemicals" with their
neighbors during the growth process. The quantity of chemicals that a cell
produces, as well as the differentiation value of the cell in the phenotype,
are controlled by a Neural Network (the genotype) that takes as inputs the
chemicals produced by the neighboring cells at the previous time step. In the
proposed model, the number of iterations of the growth process is not
pre-determined, but emerges during evolution: only organisms for which the
growth process stabilizes give a phenotype (the stable state), others are
declared nonviable. The optimization of the controller is done using the NEAT
algorithm, that optimizes both the topology and the weights of the Neural
Networks. Though each cell only receives local information from its neighbors,
the experimental results of the proposed approach on the 'flags' problems (the
phenotype must match a given 2D pattern) are almost as good as those of a
direct regression approach using the same model with global information.
Moreover, the resulting multi-cellular organisms exhibit almost perfect
self-healing characteristics.

Diversity-Multiplexing Tradeoff via Asymptotic Analysis of Large MIMO Systems
2007-05-09

Loyka,Sergey
Levin,George

Diversity-multiplexing tradeoff (DMT) presents a compact framework to compare
various MIMO systems and channels in terms of the two main advantages they
provide (i.e. high data rate and/or low error rate). This tradeoff was
characterized asymptotically (SNR-> infinity) for i.i.d. Rayleigh fading
channel by Zheng and Tse [1]. The asymptotic DMT overestimates the finite-SNR
one [2]. In this paper, using the recent results on the asymptotic (in the
number of antennas) outage capacity distribution, we derive and analyze the
finite-SNR DMT for a broad class of channels (not necessarily Rayleigh fading).
Based on this, we give the convergence conditions for the asymptotic DMT to be
approached by the finite-SNR one. The multiplexing gain definition is shown to
affect critically the convergence point: when the multiplexing gain is defined
via the mean (ergodic) capacity, the convergence takes place at realistic SNR
values. Furthermore, in this case the diversity gain can also be used to
estimate the outage probability with reasonable accuracy. The multiplexing gain
definition via the high-SNR asymptote of the mean capacity (as in [1]) results
in very slow convergence for moderate to large systems (as 1/ln(SNR)^2) and,
hence, the asymptotic DMT cannot be used at realistic SNR values. For this
definition, the high-SNR threshold increases exponentially in the number of
antennas and in the multiplexing gain. For correlated keyhole channel, the
diversity gain is shown to decrease with correlation and power imbalance of the
channel. While the SNR-asymptotic DMT of Zheng and Tse does not capture this
effect, the size-asymptotic DMT does.

On Optimum Power Allocation for the V-BLAST
2007-05-09

Kostina,Victoria
Loyka,Sergey

A unified analytical framework for optimum power allocation in the unordered
V-BLAST algorithm and its comparative performance analysis are presented.
Compact closed-form approximations for the optimum power allocation are
derived, based on average total and block error rates. The choice of the
criterion has little impact on the power allocation and, overall, the optimum
strategy is to allocate more power to lower step transmitters and less to
higher ones. High-SNR approximations for optimized average block and total
error rates are given. The SNR gain of optimization is rigorously defined and
studied using analytical tools, including lower and upper bounds, high and low
SNR approximations. The gain is upper bounded by the number of transmitters,
for any modulation format and type of fading channel. While the average
optimization is less complex than the instantaneous one, its performance is
almost as good at high SNR. A measure of robustness of the optimized algorithm
is introduced and evaluated. The optimized algorithm is shown to be robust to
perturbations in individual and total transmit powers. Based on the algorithm
robustness, a pre-set power allocation is suggested as a low-complexity
alternative to the other optimization strategies, which exhibits only a minor
loss in performance over the practical SNR range.

The Optimal Design of Three Degree-of-Freedom Parallel Mechanisms for Machining Applications
2007-05-09

Chablat,Damien
Wenger,Philippe
Majou,Félix

The subject of this paper is the optimal design of a parallel mechanism
intended for three-axis machining applications. Parallel mechanisms are
interesting alternative designs in this context but most of them are designed
for three- or six-axis machining applications. In the last case, the position
and the orientation of the tool are coupled and the shape of the workspace is
complex. The aim of this paper is to use a simple parallel mechanism with
two-degree-of-freedom (dof) for translational motions and to add one leg to
have one-dof rotational motion. The kinematics and singular configurations are
studied as well as an optimization method. The three-degree-of-freedom
mechanisms analyzed in this paper can be extended to four-axis machines by
adding a fourth axis in series with the first two.

Classification of one family of 3R positioning Manipulators
2007-05-09

Baili,Maher
Wenger,Philippe
Chablat,Damien

The aim of this paper is to classify one family of 3R serial positioning
manipulators. This categorization is based on the number of cusp points of
quaternary, binary, generic and non-generic manipulators. It was found three
subsets of manipulators with 0, 2 or 4 cusp points and one homotopy class for
generic quaternary manipulators. This classification allows us to define the
design parameters for which the manipulator is cuspidal or not, i.e., for which
the manipulator can or cannot change posture without meeting a singularity,
respectively.

Degree Optimization and Stability Condition for the Min-Sum Decoder
2007-05-09

Bhattad,Kapil
Rathi,Vishwambhar
Urbanke,Ruediger

The min-sum (MS) algorithm is arguably the second most fundamental algorithm
in the realm of message passing due to its optimality (for a tree code) with
respect to the {\em block error} probability \cite{Wiberg}. There also seems to
be a fundamental relationship of MS decoding with the linear programming
decoder \cite{Koetter}. Despite its importance, its fundamental properties have
not nearly been studied as well as those of the sum-product (also known as BP)
algorithm.
  We address two questions related to the MS rule. First, we characterize the
stability condition under MS decoding. It turns out to be essentially the same
condition as under BP decoding. Second, we perform a degree distribution
optimization. Contrary to the case of BP decoding, under MS decoding the
thresholds of the best degree distributions for standard irregular LDPC
ensembles are significantly bounded away from the Shannon threshold. More
precisely, on the AWGN channel, for the best codes that we find, the gap to
capacity is 1dB for a rate 0.3 code and it is 0.4dB when the rate is 0.9 (the
gap decreases monotonically as we increase the rate).
  We also used the optimization procedure to design codes for modified MS
algorithm where the output of the check node is scaled by a constant
$1/\alpha$. For $\alpha = 1.25$, we observed that the gap to capacity was
lesser for the modified MS algorithm when compared with the MS algorithm.
However, it was still quite large, varying from 0.75 dB to 0.2 dB for rates
between 0.3 and 0.9.
  We conclude by posing what we consider to be the most important open
questions related to the MS algorithm.

An Approximation Algorithm for Shortest Descending Paths
2007-05-09

Ahmed,Mustaq
Lubiw,Anna

A path from s to t on a polyhedral terrain is descending if the height of a
point p never increases while we move p along the path from s to t. No
efficient algorithm is known to find a shortest descending path (SDP) from s to
t in a polyhedral terrain. We give a simple approximation algorithm that solves
the SDP problem on general terrains. Our algorithm discretizes the terrain with
O(n^2 X / e) Steiner points so that after an O(n^2 X / e * log(n X /e))-time
preprocessing phase for a given vertex s, we can determine a (1+e)-approximate
SDP from s to any point v in O(n) time if v is either a vertex of the terrain
or a Steiner point, and in O(n X /e) time otherwise. Here n is the size of the
terrain, and X is a parameter of the geometry of the terrain.

Matroid Pathwidth and Code Trellis Complexity
2007-05-09

Kashyap,Navin

We relate the notion of matroid pathwidth to the minimum trellis
state-complexity (which we term trellis-width) of a linear code, and to the
pathwidth of a graph. By reducing from the problem of computing the pathwidth
of a graph, we show that the problem of determining the pathwidth of a
representable matroid is NP-hard. Consequently, the problem of computing the
trellis-width of a linear code is also NP-hard. For a finite field $\F$, we
also consider the class of $\F$-representable matroids of pathwidth at most
$w$, and correspondingly, the family of linear codes over $\F$ with
trellis-width at most $w$. These are easily seen to be minor-closed. Since
these matroids (and codes) have branchwidth at most $w$, a result of Geelen and
Whittle shows that such matroids (and the corresponding codes) are
characterized by finitely many excluded minors. We provide the complete list of
excluded minors for $w=1$, and give a partial list for $w=2$.

Machine and Component Residual Life Estimation through the Application of Neural Networks
2007-05-10

Herzog,M. A.
Marwala,T.
Heyns,P. S.

This paper concerns the use of neural networks for predicting the residual
life of machines and components. In addition, the advantage of using
condition-monitoring data to enhance the predictive capability of these neural
networks was also investigated. A number of neural network variations were
trained and tested with the data of two different reliability-related datasets.
The first dataset represents the renewal case where the failed unit is repaired
and restored to a good-as-new condition. Data was collected in the laboratory
by subjecting a series of similar test pieces to fatigue loading with a
hydraulic actuator. The average prediction error of the various neural networks
being compared varied from 431 to 841 seconds on this dataset, where test
pieces had a characteristic life of 8,971 seconds. The second dataset was
collected from a group of pumps used to circulate a water and magnetite
solution within a plant. The data therefore originated from a repaired system
affected by reliability degradation. When optimized, the multi-layer perceptron
neural networks trained with the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm and the general
regression neural network produced a sum-of-squares error within 11.1% of each
other. The potential for using neural networks for residual life prediction and
the advantage of incorporating condition-based data into the model were proven
for both examples.

Subjective Evaluation of Forms in an Immersive Environment
2007-05-10

Petiot,Jean-François
Chablat,Damien

User's perception of product, by essence subjective, is a major topic in
marketing and industrial design. Many methods, based on users' tests, are used
so as to characterise this perception. We are interested in three main methods:
multidimensional scaling, semantic differential method, and preference mapping.
These methods are used to built a perceptual space, in order to position the
new product, to specify requirements by the study of user's preferences, to
evaluate some product attributes, related in particular to style (aesthetic).
These early stages of the design are primordial for a good orientation of the
project. In parallel, virtual reality tools and interfaces are more and more
efficient for suggesting to the user complex feelings, and creating in this way
various levels of perceptions. In this article, we present on an example the
use of multidimensional scaling, semantic differential method and preference
mapping for the subjective assessment of virtual products. These products,
which geometrical form is variable, are defined with a CAD model and are
proposed to the user with a spacemouse and stereoscopic glasses. Advantages and
limitations of such evaluation is next discussed..

difficult to understand for the end-users. To catch his attention, we propose
to amplify the problems of the mechanisms in order to help him to take the good

A classification of a family of 3-revolute (3R) positioning manipulators is

The workspace is characterized in a half-cross section by the singular curves
of the manipulator. The workspace topology is defined by the number of cusps
and nodes that appear on these singular curves. The design parameters space is
shown to be partitioned into nine subspaces of distinct workspace topologies.

An Algorithm for Computing Cusp Points in the Joint Space of 3-RPR Parallel Manipulators

Zein,Mazen
Wenger,Philippe
Chablat,Damien

This paper presents an algorithm for detecting and computing the cusp points
in the joint space of 3-RPR planar parallel manipulators. In manipulator
kinematics, cusp points are special points, which appear on the singular curves
of the manipulators. The nonsingular change of assembly mode of 3-RPR parallel
manipulators was shown to be associated with the existence of cusp points. At
each of these points, three direct kinematic solutions coincide. In the
literature, a condition for the existence of three coincident direct kinematic
solutions was established, but has never been exploited, because the algebra
involved was too complicated to be solved. The algorithm presented in this
paper solves this equation and detects all the cusp points in the joint space
of these manipulators.

DWEB: A Data Warehouse Engineering Benchmark
2007-05-10

Darmont,Jérôme
Bentayeb,Fadila
Boussaïd,Omar

Data warehouse architectural choices and optimization techniques are critical
to decision support query performance. To facilitate these choices, the
performance of the designed data warehouse must be assessed. This is usually
done with the help of benchmarks, which can either help system users comparing
the performances of different systems, or help system engineers testing the
effect of various design choices. While the TPC standard decision support
benchmarks address the first point, they are not tuneable enough to address the
second one and fail to model different data warehouse schemas. By contrast, our
Data Warehouse Engineering Benchmark (DWEB) allows to generate various ad-hoc
synthetic data warehouses and workloads. DWEB is fully parameterized to fulfill
data warehouse design needs. However, two levels of parameterization keep it
relatively easy to tune. Finally, DWEB is implemented as a Java free software
that can be interfaced with most existing relational database management
systems. A sample usage of DWEB is also provided in this paper.

DOEF: A Dynamic Object Evaluation Framework
2007-05-10

He,Zhen

In object-oriented or object-relational databases such as multimedia
databases or most XML databases, access patterns are not static, i.e.,
applications do not always access the same objects in the same order
repeatedly. However, this has been the way these databases and associated
optimisation techniques like clustering have been evaluated up to now. This
paper opens up research regarding this issue by proposing a dynamic object
evaluation framework (DOEF) that accomplishes access pattern change by defining
configurable styles of change. This preliminary prototype has been designed to
be open and fully extensible. To illustrate the capabilities of DOEF, we used
it to compare the performances of four state of the art dynamic clustering
algorithms. The results show that DOEF is indeed effective at determining the
adaptability of each dynamic clustering algorithm to changes in access pattern.

Decision tree modeling with relational views
2007-05-10

Bentayeb,Fadila
Darmont,Jérôme

Data mining is a useful decision support technique that can be used to
discover production rules in warehouses or corporate data. Data mining research
has made much effort to apply various mining algorithms efficiently on large
databases. However, a serious problem in their practical application is the
long processing time of such algorithms. Nowadays, one of the key challenges is
to integrate data mining methods within the framework of traditional database
systems. Indeed, such implementations can take advantage of the efficiency
provided by SQL engines. In this paper, we propose an integrating approach for
decision trees within a classical database system. In other words, we try to
discover knowledge from relational databases, in the form of production rules,
via a procedure embedding SQL queries. The obtained decision tree is defined by
successive, related relational views. Each view corresponds to a given
population in the underlying decision tree. We selected the classical Induction
Decision Tree (ID3) algorithm to build the decision tree. To prove that our
implementation of ID3 works properly, we successfully compared the output of
our procedure with the output of an existing and validated data mining
software, SIPINA. Furthermore, since our approach is tuneable, it can be
generalized to any other similar decision tree-based method.

Warehousing Web Data

In a data warehousing process, mastering the data preparation phase allows
substantial gains in terms of time and performance when performing
multidimensional analysis or using data mining algorithms. Furthermore, a data
warehouse can require external data. The web is a prevalent data source in this
context. In this paper, we propose a modeling process for integrating diverse
and heterogeneous (so-called multiform) data into a unified format.
Furthermore, the very schema definition provides first-rate metadata in our
data warehousing context. At the conceptual level, a complex object is
represented in UML. Our logical model is an XML schema that can be described
with a DTD or the XML-Schema language. Eventually, we have designed a Java
prototype that transforms our multiform input data into XML documents
representing our physical model. Then, the XML documents we obtain are mapped
into a relational database we view as an ODS (Operational Data Storage), whose
content will have to be re-modeled in a multidimensional way to allow its
storage in a star schema-based warehouse and, later, its analysis.

Web data modeling for integration in data warehouses

In a data warehousing process, the data preparation phase is crucial.
Mastering this phase allows substantial gains in terms of time and performance
when performing a multidimensional analysis or using data mining algorithms.
Furthermore, a data warehouse can require external data. The web is a prevalent
data source in this context, but the data broadcasted on this medium are very
heterogeneous. We propose in this paper a UML conceptual model for a complex
object representing a superclass of any useful data source (databases, plain
texts, HTML and XML documents, images, sounds, video clips...). The translation
into a logical model is achieved with XML, which helps integrating all these
diverse, heterogeneous data into a unified format, and whose schema definition
provides first-rate metadata in our data warehousing context. Moreover, we
benefit from XML's flexibility, extensibility and from the richness of the
semi-structured data model, but we are still able to later map XML documents
into a database if more structuring is needed.

Actin - Technical Report

Kibria,Raihan H.

The Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT) can be solved efficiently with
variants of the DPLL algorithm. For industrial SAT problems, DPLL with conflict
analysis dependent dynamic decision heuristics has proved to be particularly
efficient, e.g. in Chaff. In this work, algorithms that initialize the variable
activity values in the solver MiniSAT v1.14 by analyzing the CNF are evolved
using genetic programming (GP), with the goal to reduce the total number of
conflicts of the search and the solving time. The effect of using initial
activities other than zero is examined by initializing with random numbers. The
possibility of countering the detrimental effects of reordering the CNF with
improved initialization is investigated. The best result found (with validation
testing on further problems) was used in the solver Actin, which was submitted
to SAT-Race 2006.

A note on module-composed graphs

2007-07-22
Gurski,Frank

In this paper we consider module-composed graphs, i.e. graphs which can be
defined by a sequence of one-vertex insertions v_1,...,v_n, such that the
neighbourhood of vertex v_i, 2<= i<= n, forms a module (a homogeneous set) of
the graph defined by vertices v_1,..., v_{i-1}.
  We show that module-composed graphs are HHDS-free and thus homogeneously
orderable, weakly chordal, and perfect. Every bipartite distance hereditary
graph, every (co-2C_4,P_4)-free graph and thus every trivially perfect graph is
module-composed. We give an O(|V_G|(|V_G|+|E_G|)) time algorithm to decide
whether a given graph G is module-composed and construct a corresponding
module-sequence.
  For the case of bipartite graphs, module-composed graphs are exactly distance
hereditary graphs, which implies simple linear time algorithms for their
recognition and construction of a corresponding module-sequence.

development of a wireless LAN(WLAN) is highlighted. This WLAN utilizes direct
sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) technology at 902MHz RF carrier frequency in
its physical layer. Cost effective installation and antijaming property of
spread spectrum technology are the major advantages of this work.

HMM Speaker Identification Using Linear and Non-linear Merging Techniques
2007-05-11

Mahola,Unathi
Nelwamondo,Fulufhelo V.
Marwala,Tshilidzi

Speaker identification is a powerful, non-invasive and in-expensive biometric
technique. The recognition accuracy, however, deteriorates when noise levels
affect a specific band of frequency. In this paper, we present a sub-band based
speaker identification that intends to improve the live testing performance.
Each frequency sub-band is processed and classified independently. We also
compare the linear and non-linear merging techniques for the sub-bands
recognizer. Support vector machines and Gaussian Mixture models are the
non-linear merging techniques that are investigated. Results showed that the
sub-band based method used with linear merging techniques enormously improved
the performance of the speaker identification over the performance of wide-band
recognizers when tested live. A live testing improvement of 9.78% was achieved

A Class of LDPC Erasure Distributions with Closed-Form Threshold Expression
2007-05-11

Paolini,E.
Chiani,M.

In this paper, a family of low-density parity-check (LDPC) degree
distributions, whose decoding threshold on the binary erasure channel (BEC)
admits a simple closed form, is presented. These degree distributions are a
subset of the check regular distributions (i.e. all the check nodes have the
same degree), and are referred to as $p$-positive distributions. It is given
proof that the threshold for a $p$-positive distribution is simply expressed by
$[\lambda'(0)\rho'(1)]^{-1}$. Besides this closed form threshold expression,
the $p$-positive distributions exhibit three additional properties. First, for
given code rate, check degree and maximum variable degree, they are in some
cases characterized by a threshold which is extremely close to that of the best
known check regular distributions, under the same set of constraints. Second,
the threshold optimization problem within the $p$-positive class can be solved
in some cases with analytic methods, without using any numerical optimization
tool. Third, these distributions can achieve the BEC capacity. The last
property is shown by proving that the well-known binomial degree distributions
belong to the $p$-positive family.

Non-Computability of Consciousness
2007-05-11

Song,Daegene

With the great success in simulating many intelligent behaviors using
computing devices, there has been an ongoing debate whether all conscious
activities are computational processes. In this paper, the answer to this
question is shown to be no. A certain phenomenon of consciousness is
demonstrated to be fully represented as a computational process using a quantum
computer. Based on the computability criterion discussed with Turing machines,
the model constructed is shown to necessarily involve a non-computable element.
The concept that this is solely a quantum effect and does not work for a
classical case is also discussed.

Principal Component Analysis and Automatic Relevance Determination in Damage Identification
2007-05-11

Mdlazi,L.
Marwala,T.
Stander,C. J.
Scheffer,C.
Heyns,P. S.

This paper compares two neural network input selection schemes, the Principal
Component Analysis (PCA) and the Automatic Relevance Determination (ARD) based
on Mac-Kay's evidence framework. The PCA takes all the input data and projects
it onto a lower dimension space, thereby reduc-ing the dimension of the input
space. This input reduction method often results with parameters that have
significant influence on the dynamics of the data being diluted by those that
do not influence the dynamics of the data. The ARD selects the most relevant
input parameters and discards those that do not contribute significantly to the
dynamics of the data being modelled. The ARD sometimes results with important
input parameters being discarded thereby compromising the dynamics of the data.
The PCA and ARD methods are implemented together with a Multi-Layer-Perceptron
(MLP) network for fault identification in structures and the performance of the
two methods is as-sessed. It is observed that ARD and PCA give similar
accu-racy levels when used as input-selection schemes. There-fore, the choice
of input-selection scheme is dependent on the nature of the data being
processed.

Evolutionary Optimisation Methods for Template Based Image Registration
2007-05-11

Machowski,Lukasz A
Marwala,Tshilidzi

This paper investigates the use of evolutionary optimisation techniques to
register a template with a scene image. An error function is created to measure
the correspondence of the template to the image. The problem presented here is
to optimise the horizontal, vertical and scaling parameters that register the
template with the scene. The Genetic Algorithm, Simulated Annealing and
Particle Swarm Optimisations are compared to a Nelder-Mead Simplex optimisation
with starting points chosen in a pre-processing stage. The paper investigates
the precision and accuracy of each method and shows that all four methods
perform favourably for image registration. SA is the most precise, GA is the
most accurate. PSO is a good mix of both and the Simplex method returns local
minima the most. A pre-processing stage should be investigated for the
evolutionary methods in order to improve performance. Discrete versions of the
optimisation methods should be investigated to further improve computational
performance.

Option Pricing Using Bayesian Neural Networks
2007-05-11

Pires,Michael Maio
Marwala,Tshilidzi

Options have provided a field of much study because of the complexity
involved in pricing them. The Black-Scholes equations were developed to price
options but they are only valid for European styled options. There is added
complexity when trying to price American styled options and this is why the use
of neural networks has been proposed. Neural Networks are able to predict
outcomes based on past data. The inputs to the networks here are stock
volatility, strike price and time to maturity with the output of the network
being the call option price. There are two techniques for Bayesian neural
networks used. One is Automatic Relevance Determination (for Gaussian
Approximation) and one is a Hybrid Monte Carlo method, both used with
Multi-Layer Perceptrons.

A Tighter Analysis of Setcover Greedy Algorithm for Test Set

Setcover greedy algorithm is a natural approximation algorithm for test set
problem. This paper gives a precise and tighter analysis of performance
guarantee of this algorithm. The author improves the performance guarantee
$2\ln n$ which derives from set cover problem to $1.1354\ln n$ by applying the
potential function technique. In addition, the author gives a nontrivial lower
bound $1.0004609\ln n$ of performance guarantee of this algorithm. This lower
bound, together with the matching bound of information content heuristic,
confirms the fact information content heuristic is slightly better than
setcover greedy algorithm in worst case.

A population of committees of agents that learn by using neural networks is
implemented to simulate the stock market. Each committee of agents, which is
regarded as a player in a game, is optimised by continually adapting the
architecture of the agents using genetic algorithms. The committees of agents
buy and sell stocks by following this procedure: (1) obtain the current price
of stocks; (2) predict the future price of stocks; (3) and for a given price
trade until all the players are mutually satisfied. The trading of stocks is
conducted by following these rules: (1) if a player expects an increase in
price then it tries to buy the stock; (2) else if it expects a drop in the
price, it sells the stock; (3)and the order in which a player participates in
the game is random. The proposed procedure is implemented to simulate trading
of three stocks, namely, the Dow Jones, the Nasdaq and the S&P 500. A linear
relationship between the number of players and agents versus the computational
time to run the complete simulation is observed. It is also found that no
player has a monopolistic advantage.

Finite Element Model Updating Using Response Surface Method
2007-05-12

Marwala,Tshilidzi

This paper proposes the response surface method for finite element model
updating. The response surface method is implemented by approximating the
finite element model surface response equation by a multi-layer perceptron. The
updated parameters of the finite element model were calculated using genetic
algorithm by optimizing the surface response equation. The proposed method was
compared to the existing methods that use simulated annealing or genetic
algorithm together with a full finite element model for finite element model
updating. The proposed method was tested on an unsymmetri-cal H-shaped
structure. It was observed that the proposed method gave the updated natural
frequen-cies and mode shapes that were of the same order of accuracy as those
given by simulated annealing and genetic algorithm. Furthermore, it was
observed that the response surface method achieved these results at a
computational speed that was more than 2.5 times as fast as the genetic
algorithm and a full finite element model and 24 times faster than the
simulated annealing.

H-shaped structure. It is observed that the proposed method gives updated
natural frequencies the most accurate and followed by those given by an updated
model that was obtained using the GA and a full FE model. It is also observed
that the proposed method gives updated mode shapes that are best correlated to
the measured ones, followed by those given by an updated model that was
obtained using the SA and a full FE model. Furthermore, it is observed that the
PSO achieves this accuracy at a computational speed that is faster than that by
the GA and a full FE model which is faster than the SA and a full FE model.

Energy-Efficient Resource Allocation in Wireless Networks: An Overview of Game-Theoretic Approaches
2007-05-13

Meshkati,Farhad
Poor,H. Vincent
Schwartz,Stuart C.

An overview of game-theoretic approaches to energy-efficient resource
allocation in wireless networks is presented. Focusing on multiple-access
networks, it is demonstrated that game theory can be used as an effective tool
to study resource allocation in wireless networks with quality-of-service (QoS)
constraints. A family of non-cooperative (distributed) games is presented in
which each user seeks to choose a strategy that maximizes its own utility while
satisfying its QoS requirements. The utility function considered here measures
the number of reliable bits that are transmitted per joule of energy consumed
and, hence, is particulary suitable for energy-constrained networks. The
actions available to each user in trying to maximize its own utility are at
least the choice of the transmit power and, depending on the situation, the
user may also be able to choose its transmission rate, modulation, packet size,
multiuser receiver, multi-antenna processing algorithm, or carrier allocation
strategy. The best-response strategy and Nash equilibrium for each game is
presented. Using this game-theoretic framework, the effects of power control,
rate control, modulation, temporal and spatial signal processing, carrier
allocation strategy and delay QoS constraints on energy efficiency and network
capacity are quantified.

A Game-Theoretic Approach to Energy-Efficient Modulation in CDMA Networks with Delay QoS Constraints
2007-05-12

Meshkati,Farhad
Goldsmith,Andrea J.
Poor,H. Vincent
Schwartz,Stuart C.

A game-theoretic framework is used to study the effect of constellation size
on the energy efficiency of wireless networks for M-QAM modulation. A
non-cooperative game is proposed in which each user seeks to choose its
transmit power (and possibly transmit symbol rate) as well as the constellation
size in order to maximize its own utility while satisfying its delay
quality-of-service (QoS) constraint. The utility function used here measures
the number of reliable bits transmitted per joule of energy consumed, and is
particularly suitable for energy-constrained networks. The best-response
strategies and Nash equilibrium solution for the proposed game are derived. It
is shown that in order to maximize its utility (in bits per joule), a user must
choose the lowest constellation size that can accommodate the user's delay
constraint. This strategy is different from one that would maximize spectral
efficiency. Using this framework, the tradeoffs among energy efficiency, delay,
throughput and constellation size are also studied and quantified. In addition,
the effect of trellis-coded modulation on energy efficiency is discussed.

Random Linear Network Coding: A free cipher?

We consider the level of information security provided by random linear
network coding in network scenarios in which all nodes comply with the
communication protocols yet are assumed to be potential eavesdroppers (i.e.
"nice but curious"). For this setup, which differs from wiretapping scenarios
considered previously, we develop a natural algebraic security criterion, and
prove several of its key properties. A preliminary analysis of the impact of
network topology on the overall network coding security, in particular for
complete directed acyclic graphs, is also included.

Scheduling Dags under Uncertainty
2007-05-14

Malewicz,Grzegorz

This paper introduces a parallel scheduling problem where a directed acyclic
graph modeling $t$ tasks and their dependencies needs to be executed on $n$
unreliable workers. Worker $i$ executes task $j$ correctly with probability
$p_{i,j}$. The goal is to find a regimen $\Sigma$, that dictates how workers
get assigned to tasks (possibly in parallel and redundantly) throughout
execution, so as to minimize the expected completion time. This fundamental
parallel scheduling problem arises in grid computing and project management
fields, and has several applications.
  We show a polynomial time algorithm for the problem restricted to the case
when dag width is at most a constant and the number of workers is also at most
a constant. These two restrictions may appear to be too severe. However, they
are fundamentally required. Specifically, we demonstrate that the problem is
NP-hard with constant number of workers when dag width can grow, and is also
NP-hard with constant dag width when the number of workers can grow. When both
dag width and the number of workers are unconstrained, then the problem is
inapproximable within factor less than 5/4, unless P=NP.

Ontology-Supported and Ontology-Driven Conceptual Navigation on the World Wide Web
2007-05-14

Crampes,Michel
Ranwez,Sylvie

This paper presents the principles of ontology-supported and ontology-driven
conceptual navigation. Conceptual navigation realizes the independence between
resources and links to facilitate interoperability and reusability. An engine
builds dynamic links, assembles resources under an argumentative scheme and
allows optimization with a possible constraint, such as the user's available
time. Among several strategies, two are discussed in detail with examples of
applications. On the one hand, conceptual specifications for linking and
assembling are embedded in the resource meta-description with the support of
the ontology of the domain to facilitate meta-communication. Resources are like
agents looking for conceptual acquaintances with intention. On the other hand,
the domain ontology and an argumentative ontology drive the linking and
assembling strategies.

Optimal Watermark Embedding and Detection Strategies Under Limited Detection Resources
2007-05-14

Merhav,Neri
Sabbag,Erez

An information-theoretic approach is proposed to watermark embedding and
detection under limited detector resources. First, we consider the attack-free
scenario under which asymptotically optimal decision regions in the
Neyman-Pearson sense are proposed, along with the optimal embedding rule.
Later, we explore the case of zero-mean i.i.d. Gaussian covertext distribution
with unknown variance under the attack-free scenario. For this case, we propose
a lower bound on the exponential decay rate of the false-negative probability
and prove that the optimal embedding and detecting strategy is superior to the
customary linear, additive embedding strategy in the exponential sense.
Finally, these results are extended to the case of memoryless attacks and
general worst case attacks. Optimal decision regions and embedding rules are
offered, and the worst attack channel is identified.

Crystallization in large wireless networks
2007-05-14

Morgenshtern,Veniamin I.
Boelcskei,Helmut

We analyze fading interference relay networks where M single-antenna
source-destination terminal pairs communicate concurrently and in the same
frequency band through a set of K single-antenna relays using half-duplex
two-hop relaying. Assuming that the relays have channel state information
(CSI), it is shown that in the large-M limit, provided K grows fast enough as a
function of M, the network "decouples" in the sense that the individual
source-destination terminal pair capacities are strictly positive. The
corresponding required rate of growth of K as a function of M is found to be
sufficient to also make the individual source-destination fading links converge
to nonfading links. We say that the network "crystallizes" as it breaks up into
a set of effectively isolated "wires in the air". A large-deviations analysis
is performed to characterize the "crystallization" rate, i.e., the rate (as a
function of M,K) at which the decoupled links converge to nonfading links. In
the course of this analysis, we develop a new technique for characterizing the
large-deviations behavior of certain sums of dependent random variables. For
the case of no CSI at the relay level, assuming amplify-and-forward relaying,
we compute the per source-destination terminal pair capacity for M,K converging
to infinity, with K/M staying fixed, using tools from large random matrix
theory.

Double Sided Watermark Embedding and Detection with Perceptual Analysis
2007-05-14

Zhong,Jidong
Huang,Shangteng

In our previous work, we introduced a double-sided technique that utilizes
but not reject the host interference. Due to its nice property of utilizing but
not rejecting the host interference, it has a big advantage over the host
interference schemes in that the perceptual analysis can be easily implemented
for our scheme to achieve the locally bounded maximum embedding strength. Thus,
in this work, we detail how to implement the perceptual analysis in our
double-sided schemes since the perceptual analysis is very important for
improving the fidelity of watermarked contents. Through the extensive
performance comparisons, we can further validate the performance advantage of
our double-sided schemes.

Towards Informative Statistical Flow Inversion
2007-05-14

Clegg,Richard G.
Haddadi,Hamed
Landa,Raul
Rio,Miguel

A problem which has recently attracted research attention is that of
estimating the distribution of flow sizes in internet traffic. On high traffic
links it is sometimes impossible to record every packet. Researchers have
approached the problem of estimating flow lengths from sampled packet data in
two separate ways. Firstly, different sampling methodologies can be tried to
more accurately measure the desired system parameters. One such method is the
sample-and-hold method where, if a packet is sampled, all subsequent packets in
that flow are sampled. Secondly, statistical methods can be used to ``invert''
the sampled data and produce an estimate of flow lengths from a sample.
  In this paper we propose, implement and test two variants on the
sample-and-hold method. In addition we show how the sample-and-hold method can
be inverted to get an estimation of the genuine distribution of flow sizes.
Experiments are carried out on real network traces to compare standard packet
sampling with three variants of sample-and-hold. The methods are compared for
their ability to reconstruct the genuine distribution of flow sizes in the
traffic.

A Branch and Cut Algorithm for the Halfspace Depth Problem
2007-05-14

Chen,Dan

The concept of data depth in non-parametric multivariate descriptive
statistics is the generalization of the univariate rank method to multivariate
data. Halfspace depth is a measure of data depth. Given a set S of points and a
point p, the halfspace depth (or rank) k of p is defined as the minimum number
of points of S contained in any closed halfspace with p on its boundary.
Computing halfspace depth is NP-hard, and it is equivalent to the Maximum
Feasible Subsystem problem. In this thesis a mixed integer program is
formulated with the big-M method for the halfspace depth problem. We suggest a
branch and cut algorithm. In this algorithm, Chinneck's heuristic algorithm is
used to find an upper bound and a related technique based on sensitivity
analysis is used for branching. Irreducible Infeasible Subsystem (IIS) hitting
set cuts are applied. We also suggest a binary search algorithm which may be
more stable numerically. The algorithms are implemented with the BCP framework
from the COIN-OR project.

We consider the well known \emph{Least Recently Used} (LRU) replacement
algorithm and analyze it under the independent reference model and generalized
power-law demand. For this extensive family of demand distributions we derive a
closed-form expression for the per object steady-state hit ratio. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the first analytic derivation of the per object hit
ratio of LRU that can be obtained in constant time without requiring laborious
numeric computations or simulation. Since most applications of replacement
algorithms include (at least) some scenarios under i.i.d. requests, our method
has substantial practical value, especially when having to analyze multiple
caches, where existing numeric methods and simulation become too time
consuming.

On the Hopcroft's minimization algorithm

Paun,Andrei

We show that the absolute worst case time complexity for Hopcroft's
minimization algorithm applied to unary languages is reached only for de Bruijn
words. A previous paper by Berstel and Carton gave the example of de Bruijn
words as a language that requires O(n log n) steps by carefully choosing the
splitting sets and processing these sets in a FIFO mode. We refine the previous
result by showing that the Berstel/Carton example is actually the absolute
worst case time complexity in the case of unary languages. We also show that a
LIFO implementation will not achieve the same worst time complexity for the
case of unary languages. Lastly, we show that the same result is valid also for
the cover automata and a modification of the Hopcroft's algorithm, modification
used in minimization of cover automata.

Bit-Interleaved Coded Multiple Beamforming with Imperfect CSIT

Sengul,Ersin
Park,Hong Ju
Ayanoglu,Ender

This paper addresses the performance of bit-interleaved coded multiple
beamforming (BICMB) [1], [2] with imperfect knowledge of beamforming vectors.
Most studies for limited-rate channel state information at the transmitter
(CSIT) assume that the precoding matrix has an invariance property under an
arbitrary unitary transform. In BICMB, this property does not hold. On the
other hand, the optimum precoder and detector for BICMB are invariant under a
diagonal unitary transform. In order to design a limited-rate CSIT system for
BICMB, we propose a new distortion measure optimum under this invariance. Based
on this new distortion measure, we introduce a new set of centroids and employ
the generalized Lloyd algorithm for codebook design. We provide simulation
results demonstrating the performance improvement achieved with the proposed
distortion measure and the codebook design for various receivers with linear
detectors. We show that although these receivers have the same performance for
perfect CSIT, their performance varies under imperfect CSIT.

Multi-Dimensional Recurrent Neural Networks

Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have proved effective at one dimensional
sequence learning tasks, such as speech and online handwriting recognition.
Some of the properties that make RNNs suitable for such tasks, for example
robustness to input warping, and the ability to access contextual information,
are also desirable in multidimensional domains. However, there has so far been
no direct way of applying RNNs to data with more than one spatio-temporal
dimension. This paper introduces multi-dimensional recurrent neural networks
(MDRNNs), thereby extending the potential applicability of RNNs to vision,
video processing, medical imaging and many other areas, while avoiding the
scaling problems that have plagued other multi-dimensional models. Experimental
results are provided for two image segmentation tasks.

Mean Field Models of Message Throughput in Dynamic Peer-to-Peer Systems
2007-05-14

Harwood,Aaron
Ohrimenko,Olga

The churn rate of a peer-to-peer system places direct limitations on the rate
at which messages can be effectively communicated to a group of peers. These
limitations are independent of the topology and message transmission latency.
In this paper we consider a peer-to-peer network, based on the Engset model,
where peers arrive and depart independently at random. We show how the arrival
and departure rates directly limit the capacity for message streams to be
broadcast to all other peers, by deriving mean field models that accurately
describe the system behavior. Our models cover the unit and more general k
buffer cases, i.e. where a peer can buffer at most k messages at any one time,
and we give results for both single and multi-source message streams. We define
coverage rate as peer-messages per unit time, i.e. the rate at which a number
of peers receive messages, and show that the coverage rate is limited by the
churn rate and buffer size. Our theory introduces an Instantaneous Message
Exchange (IME) model and provides a template for further analysis of more
complicated systems. Using the IME model, and assuming random processes, we
have obtained very accurate equations of the system dynamics in a variety of
interesting cases, that allow us to tune a peer-to-peer system. It remains to
be seen if we can maintain this accuracy for general processes and when
applying a non-instantaneous model.

saving of manpower in the form of developing a new application of their ideas
in Intelligent Transport system(ITS). The world statistics shows that by
incorporating such wireless radar system in the car would decrease the world
road accident by 8-10% yearly. The wireless technology has to be chosen
properly which is capable of tackling the severe interferences present in the
open road. A combined digital technology like Spread spectrum along with
diversity reception will help a lot in this regard. Accordingly, the choice is
for FHSS based space diversity system which will utilize carrier frequency
around 5.8 GHz ISM band with available bandwidth of 80 MHz and no license. For
efficient design, the radio channel is characterized on which the design is
based. Out of two available modes e.g. Communication and Radar modes, the radar
mode is providing the conditional measurement of the range of the nearest car
after authentication of the received code, thus ensuring the reliability and
accuracy of measurement. To make the system operational in simultaneous mode,
we have started the Software Defined Radio approach for best speed and

Scientific citations in Wikipedia
2007-05-15

Nielsen,Finn Aarup

The Internet-based encyclopaedia Wikipedia has grown to become one of the
most visited web-sites on the Internet. However, critics have questioned the
quality of entries, and an empirical study has shown Wikipedia to contain
errors in a 2005 sample of science entries. Biased coverage and lack of sources
are among the "Wikipedia risks". The present work describes a simple assessment
of these aspects by examining the outbound links from Wikipedia articles to
articles in scientific journals with a comparison against journal statistics
from Journal Citation Reports such as impact factors. The results show an
increasing use of structured citation markup and good agreement with the
citation pattern seen in the scientific literature though with a slight
tendency to cite articles in high-impact journals such as Nature and Science.
These results increase confidence in Wikipedia as an good information organizer
for science in general.

Improvements to the Psi-SSA representation
2007-05-15

De Ferriere,Francois

Modern compiler implementations use the Static Single Assignment
representation as a way to efficiently implement optimizing algorithms. However
this representation is not well adapted to architectures with a predicated
instruction set. The Psi-SSA representation extends the SSA representation such
that standard SSA algorithms can be easily adapted to an architecture with a
fully predicated instruction set. A new pseudo operation, the Psi operation, is
introduced to merge several conditional definitions into a unique definition.

Pesek,Igor
Žerovnik,Janez

This paper considers heuristics for well known resource-constrained project
scheduling problem (RCPSP). First a feasible schedule is constructed using
randomized best insertion algorithm. The construction is followed by a local
search where a new solution is generated as follows: first we randomly delete m
activities from the list, which are then reinserted in the list in consecutive
order. At the end of run, the schedule with the minimum makespan is selected.
Experimental work shows very good results on standard test instances found in

Feautrier,Paul

Array-OL is a high-level specification language dedicated to the definition
of intensive signal processing applications. Several tools exist for
implementing an Array-OL specification as a data parallel program. While
Array-OL can be used directly, it is often convenient to be able to deduce part
of the specification from a sequential version of the application. This paper
proposes such an analysis and examines its feasibility and its limits.

On the freezing of variables in random constraint satisfaction problems
2007-05-15

Semerjian,Guilhem

The set of solutions of random constraint satisfaction problems (zero energy
groundstates of mean-field diluted spin glasses) undergoes several structural
phase transitions as the amount of constraints is increased. This set first
breaks down into a large number of well separated clusters. At the freezing
transition, which is in general distinct from the clustering one, some
variables (spins) take the same value in all solutions of a given cluster. In
this paper we study the critical behavior around the freezing transition, which
appears in the unfrozen phase as the divergence of the sizes of the
rearrangements induced in response to the modification of a variable. The
formalism is developed on generic constraint satisfaction problems and applied
in particular to the random satisfiability of boolean formulas and to the
coloring of random graphs. The computation is first performed in random tree
ensembles, for which we underline a connection with percolation models and with
the reconstruction problem of information theory. The validity of these results
for the original random ensembles is then discussed in the framework of the
cavity method.

From Nondeterministic B\"uchi and Streett Automata to Deterministic Parity Automata
2007-05-15
2007-08-14
Piterman,Nir

In this paper we revisit Safra's determinization constructions for automata
on infinite words. We show how to construct deterministic automata with fewer
states and, most importantly, parity acceptance conditions. Determinization is
used in numerous applications, such as reasoning about tree automata,
satisfiability of CTL*, and realizability and synthesis of logical
specifications. The upper bounds for all these applications are reduced by
using the smaller deterministic automata produced by our construction. In
addition, the parity acceptance conditions allows to use more efficient
algorithms (when compared to handling Rabin or Streett acceptance conditions).

On tractability and congruence distributivity
2007-05-15

Kiss,Emil
Valeriote,Matthew

Constraint languages that arise from finite algebras have recently been the
object of study, especially in connection with the Dichotomy Conjecture of
Feder and Vardi. An important class of algebras are those that generate
congruence distributive varieties and included among this class are lattices,
and more generally, those algebras that have near-unanimity term operations. An
algebra will generate a congruence distributive variety if and only if it has a
sequence of ternary term operations, called Jonsson terms, that satisfy certain
equations.
  We prove that constraint languages consisting of relations that are invariant
under a short sequence of Jonsson terms are tractable by showing that such
languages have bounded relational width.

Response Prediction of Structural System Subject to Earthquake Motions using Artificial Neural Network
2007-05-15

Chakraverty,S.
Marwala,T.
Gupta,Pallavi
Tettey,Thando

This paper uses Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models to compute response of
structural system subject to Indian earthquakes at Chamoli and Uttarkashi
ground motion data. The system is first trained for a single real earthquake
data. The trained ANN architecture is then used to simulate earthquakes with
various intensities and it was found that the predicted responses given by ANN
model are accurate for practical purposes. When the ANN is trained by a part of
the ground motion data, it can also identify the responses of the structural
system well. In this way the safeness of the structural systems may be
predicted in case of future earthquakes without waiting for the earthquake to
occur for the lessons. Time period and the corresponding maximum response of
the building for an earthquake has been evaluated, which is again trained to
predict the maximum response of the building at different time periods. The
trained time period versus maximum response ANN model is also tested for real
earthquake data of other place, which was not used in the training and was
found to be in good agreement.

Fault Classification using Pseudomodal Energies and Neuro-fuzzy modelling
2007-05-15

Marwala,Tshilidzi
Tettey,Thando
Chakraverty,Snehashish

This paper presents a fault classification method which makes use of a
Takagi-Sugeno neuro-fuzzy model and Pseudomodal energies calculated from the
vibration signals of cylindrical shells. The calculation of Pseudomodal
Energies, for the purposes of condition monitoring, has previously been found
to be an accurate method of extracting features from vibration signals. This
calculation is therefore used to extract features from vibration signals
obtained from a diverse population of cylindrical shells. Some of the cylinders
in the population have faults in different substructures. The pseudomodal
energies calculated from the vibration signals are then used as inputs to a
neuro-fuzzy model. A leave-one-out cross-validation process is used to test the
performance of the model. It is found that the neuro-fuzzy model is able to
classify faults with an accuracy of 91.62%, which is higher than the previously
used multilayer perceptron.

Multi-Access MIMO Systems with Finite Rate Channel State Feedback
2007-05-15

Dai,Wei
Rider,Brian
Liu,Youjian

This paper characterizes the effect of finite rate channel state feedback on
the sum rate of a multi-access multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system. We
propose to control the users jointly, specifically, we first choose the users
jointly and then select the corresponding beamforming vectors jointly. To
quantify the sum rate, this paper introduces the composite Grassmann manifold
and the composite Grassmann matrix. By characterizing the distortion rate
function on the composite Grassmann manifold and calculating the logdet
function of a random composite Grassmann matrix, a good sum rate approximation
is derived. According to the distortion rate function on the composite
Grassmann manifold, the loss due to finite beamforming decreases exponentially
as the feedback bits on beamforming increases.

Quantization Bounds on Grassmann Manifolds of Arbitrary Dimensions and MIMO Communications with Feedback
2007-05-15

Dai,Wei
Liu,Youjian
Rider,Brian

This paper considers the quantization problem on the Grassmann manifold with
dimension n and p. The unique contribution is the derivation of a closed-form
formula for the volume of a metric ball in the Grassmann manifold when the
radius is sufficiently small. This volume formula holds for Grassmann manifolds
with arbitrary dimension n and p, while previous results are only valid for
either p=1 or a fixed p with asymptotically large n. Based on the volume
formula, the Gilbert-Varshamov and Hamming bounds for sphere packings are
obtained. Assuming a uniformly distributed source and a distortion metric based
on the squared chordal distance, tight lower and upper bounds are established
for the distortion rate tradeoff. Simulation results match the derived results.
As an application of the derived quantization bounds, the information rate of a
Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) system with finite-rate channel-state
feedback is accurately quantified for arbitrary finite number of antennas,
while previous results are only valid for either Multiple-Input Single-Output
(MISO) systems or those with asymptotically large number of transmit antennas
but fixed number of receive antennas.

On the Information Rate of MIMO Systems with Finite Rate Channel State Feedback and Power On/Off Strategy
2007-05-15

Dai,Wei
Liu,Youjian
Rider,Brian
Lau,Vincent K. N.

This paper quantifies the information rate of multiple-input multiple-output
(MIMO) systems with finite rate channel state feedback and power on/off
strategy. In power on/off strategy, a beamforming vector (beam) is either
turned on (denoted by on-beam) with a constant power or turned off. We prove
that the ratio of the optimal number of on-beams and the number of antennas
converges to a constant for a given signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) when the number
of transmit and receive antennas approaches infinity simultaneously and when
beamforming is perfect. Based on this result, a near optimal strategy, i.e.,
power on/off strategy with a constant number of on-beams, is discussed. For
such a strategy, we propose the power efficiency factor to quantify the effect
of imperfect beamforming. A formula is proposed to compute the maximum power
efficiency factor achievable given a feedback rate. The information rate of the
overall MIMO system can be approximated by combining the asymptotic results and
the formula for power efficiency factor. Simulations show that this
approximation is accurate for all SNR regimes.

Unequal dimensional small balls and quantization on Grassmann Manifolds
2007-05-16

Dai,Wei
Rider,Brian
Liu,Youjian

The Grassmann manifold G_{n,p}(L) is the set of all p-dimensional planes
(through the origin) in the n-dimensional Euclidean space L^{n}, where L is
either R or C. This paper considers an unequal dimensional quantization in
which a source in G_{n,p}(L) is quantized through a code in G_{n,q}(L), where p
and q are not necessarily the same. It is different from most works in
literature where p\equiv q. The analysis for unequal dimensional quantization
is based on the volume of a metric ball in G_{n,p}(L) whose center is in
G_{n,q}(L). Our chief result is a closed-form formula for the volume of a
metric ball when the radius is sufficiently small. This volume formula holds
for Grassmann manifolds with arbitrary n, p, q and L, while previous results
pertained only to some special cases. Based on this volume formula, several
bounds are derived for the rate distortion tradeoff assuming the quantization
rate is sufficiently high. The lower and upper bounds on the distortion rate
function are asymptotically identical, and so precisely quantify the asymptotic
rate distortion tradeoff. We also show that random codes are asymptotically
optimal in the sense that they achieve the minimum achievable distortion with
probability one as n and the code rate approach infinity linearly. Finally, we
discuss some applications of the derived results to communication theory. A
geometric interpretation in the Grassmann manifold is developed for capacity
calculation of additive white Gaussian noise channel. Further, the derived
distortion rate function is beneficial to characterizing the effect of
beamforming matrix selection in multi-antenna communications.

(DGA) data from bushings based on IEC60599 and IEEE C57-104 criteria for oil
impregnated paper (OIP) bushings. FST and neural networks are compared in terms
of accuracy and computational efficiency. Both FST and NN simulations were able
to diagnose the bushings condition with 10% error. By using fuzzy theory, the
maintenance department can classify bushings and know the extent of degradation
in the component.

This paper describes a systems architecture for a hybrid Centralised/Swarm
based multi-agent system. The issue of local goal assignment for agents is
investigated through the use of a global agent which teaches the agents
responses to given situations. We implement a test problem in the form of a
Pursuit game, where the Multi-Agent system is a set of captor agents. The
agents learn solutions to certain board positions from the global agent if they
are unable to find a solution. The captor agents learn through the use of
multi-layer perceptron neural networks. The global agent is able to solve board
positions through the use of a Genetic Algorithm. The cooperation between
agents and the results of the simulation are discussed here. .

On-Line Condition Monitoring using Computational Intelligence
2007-05-16

Vilakazi,C. B.
Marwala,T.
Mautla,P.
Moloto,E.

This paper presents bushing condition monitoring frameworks that use
multi-layer perceptrons (MLP), radial basis functions (RBF) and support vector
machines (SVM) classifiers. The first level of the framework determines if the
bushing is faulty or not while the second level determines the type of fault.
The diagnostic gases in the bushings are analyzed using the dissolve gas
analysis. MLP gives superior performance in terms of accuracy and training time
than SVM and RBF. In addition, an on-line bushing condition monitoring
approach, which is able to adapt to newly acquired data are introduced. This
approach is able to accommodate new classes that are introduced by incoming
data and is implemented using an incremental learning algorithm that uses MLP.
The testing results improved from 67.5% to 95.8% as new data were introduced
and the testing results improved from 60% to 95.3% as new conditions were
introduced. On average the confidence value of the framework on its decision
was 0.92.

TrustMIX: Trustworthy MIX for Energy Saving in Sensor Networks

Seigneur,Jean-Marc

MIX has recently been proposed as a new sensor scheme with better energy
management for data-gathering in Wireless Sensor Networks. However, it is not
known how it performs when some of the sensors carry out sinkhole attacks. In
this paper, we propose a variant of MIX with adjunct computational trust
management to limit the impact of such sinkhole attacks. We evaluate how MIX
resists sinkhole attacks with and without computational trust management. The
main result of this paper is to find that MIX is very vulnerable to sinkhole
attacks but that the adjunct trust management efficiently reduces the impact of
such attacks while preserving the main feature of MIX: increased lifetime of
the network.

Statistical Mechanics of Nonlinear On-line Learning for Ensemble Teachers
2007-05-16

Utsumi,Hideto
Miyoshi,Seiji
Okada,Masato

We analyze the generalization performance of a student in a model composed of
nonlinear perceptrons: a true teacher, ensemble teachers, and the student. We
calculate the generalization error of the student analytically or numerically
using statistical mechanics in the framework of on-line learning. We treat two
well-known learning rules: Hebbian learning and perceptron learning. As a
result, it is proven that the nonlinear model shows qualitatively different
behaviors from the linear model. Moreover, it is clarified that Hebbian
learning and perceptron learning show qualitatively different behaviors from
each other. In Hebbian learning, we can analytically obtain the solutions. In
this case, the generalization error monotonically decreases. The steady value
of the generalization error is independent of the learning rate. The larger the
number of teachers is and the more variety the ensemble teachers have, the
smaller the generalization error is. In perceptron learning, we have to
numerically obtain the solutions. In this case, the dynamical behaviors of the
generalization error are non-monotonic. The smaller the learning rate is, the
larger the number of teachers is; and the more variety the ensemble teachers
have, the smaller the minimum value of the generalization error is.

This paper details the use of the IT Infrastructure Library Framework (ITIL)

Wernigerode, Germany, exemplified by the Release Management Process. It is
described, how, during the course of a special ITIL project, the As-Is-Status
of the various original processes was documented as part of the process life
cycle and then transformed in the To-Be-Status, according to the ITIL Best
Practice Framework. It is also shown, how the ITIL framework fits into the
four-layered-process model, that could be derived from interviews with the
universities IT support staff, and how the various modified processes
interconnect with each other to form a value chain. The paper highlights the
final results of the project and gives an outlook on the future use of ITIL as
a business modelling tool in the IT Service Centre of Harz University. It is
currently being considered, whether the process model developed during the
project could be used as a reference model for other university IT centres.

Reduced Complexity Sphere Decoding for Square QAM via a New Lattice Representation
2007-05-16

Azzam,Luay
Ayanoglu,Ender

Sphere decoding (SD) is a low complexity maximum likelihood (ML) detection
algorithm, which has been adapted for different linear channels in digital
communications. The complexity of the SD has been shown to be exponential in
some cases, and polynomial in others and under certain assumptions. The sphere
radius and the number of nodes visited throughout the tree traversal search are
the decisive factors for the complexity of the algorithm. The radius problem
has been addressed and treated widely in the literature. In this paper, we
propose a new structure for SD, which drastically reduces the overall
complexity. The complexity is measured in terms of the floating point
operations per second (FLOPS) and the number of nodes visited throughout the
algorithm tree search. This reduction in the complexity is due to the ability
of decoding the real and imaginary parts of each jointly detected symbol
independently of each other, making use of the new lattice representation. We
further show by simulations that the new approach achieves 80% reduction in the
overall complexity compared to the conventional SD for a 2x2 system, and almost
50% reduction for the 4x4 and 6x6 cases, thus relaxing the requirements for
hardware implementation.

Using Genetic Algorithms to Optimise Rough Set Partition Sizes for HIV Data Analysis

In this paper, we present a method to optimise rough set partition sizes, to
which rule extraction is performed on HIV data. The genetic algorithm
optimisation technique is used to determine the partition sizes of a rough set
in order to maximise the rough sets prediction accuracy. The proposed method is
tested on a set of demographic properties of individuals obtained from the
South African antenatal survey. Six demographic variables were used in the
analysis, these variables are; race, age of mother, education, gravidity,
parity, and age of father, with the outcome or decision being either HIV
positive or negative. Rough set theory is chosen based on the fact that it is
easy to interpret the extracted rules. The prediction accuracy of equal width
bin partitioning is 57.7% while the accuracy achieved after optimising the
partitions is 72.8%. Several other methods have been used to analyse the HIV
data and their results are stated and compared to that of rough set theory
(RST).

Test set with redundancy is one of the focuses in recent bioinformatics
research. Set cover greedy algorithm (SGA for short) is a commonly used
algorithm for test set with redundancy. This paper proves that the
approximation ratio of SGA can be $(2-\frac{1}{2r})\ln n+{3/2}\ln r+O(\ln\ln
n)$ by using the potential function technique. This result is better than the
approximation ratio $2\ln n$ which directly derives from set multicover, when
$r=o(\frac{\ln n}{\ln\ln n})$, and is an extension of the approximability
results for plain test set.

Condition Monitoring of HV Bushings in the Presence of Missing Data Using Evolutionary Computing

The work proposes the application of neural networks with particle swarm
optimisation (PSO) and genetic algorithms (GA) to compensate for missing data
in classifying high voltage bushings. The classification is done using DGA data
from 60966 bushings based on IEEEc57.104, IEC599 and IEEE production rates
methods for oil impregnated paper (OIP) bushings. PSO and GA were compared in
terms of accuracy and computational efficiency. Both GA and PSO simulations
were able to estimate missing data values to an average 95% accuracy when only
one variable was missing. However PSO rapidly deteriorated to 66% accuracy with
two variables missing simultaneously, compared to 84% for GA. The data
estimated using GA was found to classify the conditions of bushings than the
PSO.

Informatics Carnot Machine
2007-05-17

Kafri,Oded

Based on Planck's blackbody equation it is argued that a single mode light
pulse, with a large number of photons, carries one entropy unit. Similarly, an
empty radiation mode carries no entropy. In this case, the calculated entropy
that a coded sequence of light pulses is carrying is simply the Gibbs mixing
entropy, which is identical to the logical Shannon information. This approach
is supported by a demonstration that information transmission and
amplification, by a sequence of light pulses in an optical fiber, is a classic
Carnot machine comprising of two isothermals and two adiabatic. Therefore it is
concluded that entropy under certain conditions is information.

Block Locally Optimal Preconditioned Eigenvalue Xolvers (BLOPEX) in hypre and PETSc
2007-05-17

Knyazev,A. V.
Argentati,M. E.
Lashuk,I.
Ovtchinnikov,E. E.

We describe our software package Block Locally Optimal Preconditioned
Eigenvalue Xolvers (BLOPEX) publicly released recently. BLOPEX is available as
a stand-alone serial library, as an external package to PETSc (``Portable,
Extensible Toolkit for Scientific Computation'', a general purpose suite of
tools for the scalable solution of partial differential equations and related
problems developed by Argonne National Laboratory), and is also built into {\it
hypre} (``High Performance Preconditioners'', scalable linear solvers package
developed by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory). The present BLOPEX
release includes only one solver--the Locally Optimal Block Preconditioned
Conjugate Gradient (LOBPCG) method for symmetric eigenvalue problems. {\it
hypre} provides users with advanced high-quality parallel preconditioners for
linear systems, in particular, with domain decomposition and multigrid
preconditioners. With BLOPEX, the same preconditioners can now be efficiently
used for symmetric eigenvalue problems. PETSc facilitates the integration of
independently developed application modules with strict attention to component
interoperability, and makes BLOPEX extremely easy to compile and use with
preconditioners that are available via PETSc. We present the LOBPCG algorithm
in BLOPEX for {\it hypre} and PETSc. We demonstrate numerically the scalability
of BLOPEX by testing it on a number of distributed and shared memory parallel
systems, including a Beowulf system, SUN Fire 880, an AMD dual-core Opteron
workstation, and IBM BlueGene/L supercomputer, using PETSc domain decomposition
and {\it hypre} multigrid preconditioning. We test BLOPEX on a model problem,
the standard 7-point finite-difference approximation of the 3-D Laplacian, with
the problem size in the range $10^5-10^8$.

On the monotonization of the training set

We consider the problem of minimal correction of the training set to make it
consistent with monotonic constraints. This problem arises during analysis of
data sets via techniques that require monotone data. We show that this problem
is NP-hard in general and is equivalent to finding a maximal independent set in
special orgraphs. Practically important cases of that problem considered in
detail. These are the cases when a partial order given on the replies set is a
total order or has a dimension 2. We show that the second case can be reduced
to maximization of a quadratic convex function on a convex set. For this case
we construct an approximate polynomial algorithm based on convex optimization.

Virtualization: A double-edged sword
2007-05-18

Wlodarz,Joachim J.

Virtualization became recently a hot topic once again, after being dormant
for more than twenty years. In the meantime, it has been almost forgotten, that
virtual machines are not so perfect isolating environments as it seems, when
looking at the principles. These lessons were already learnt earlier when the
first virtualized systems have been exposed to real life usage.
  Contemporary virtualization software enables instant creation and destruction
of virtual machines on a host, live migration from one host to another,
execution history manipulation, etc. These features are very useful in
practice, but also causing headaches among security specialists, especially in
current hostile network environments.
  In the present contribution we discuss the principles, potential benefits and
risks of virtualization in a deja vu perspective, related to previous
experiences with virtualization in the mainframe era.

Worst-Case Background Knowledge for Privacy-Preserving Data Publishing
2007-05-18

Halpern,Joseph Y.

Recent work has shown the necessity of considering an attacker's background
knowledge when reasoning about privacy in data publishing. However, in
practice, the data publisher does not know what background knowledge the
attacker possesses. Thus, it is important to consider the worst-case. In this
paper, we initiate a formal study of worst-case background knowledge. We
propose a language that can express any background knowledge about the data. We
provide a polynomial time algorithm to measure the amount of disclosure of
sensitive information in the worst case, given that the attacker has at most a
specified number of pieces of information in this language. We also provide a
method to efficiently sanitize the data so that the amount of disclosure in the
worst case is less than a specified threshold.

An Autonomous Distributed Admission Control Scheme for IEEE 802.11 DCF
2007-05-19

Patil,Preetam
Apte,Varsha

Admission control as a mechanism for providing QoS requires an accurate
description of the requested flow as well as already admitted flows. Since
802.11 WLAN capacity is shared between flows belonging to all stations,
admission control requires knowledge of all flows in the WLAN. Further,
estimation of the load-dependent WLAN capacity through analytical model
requires inputs about channel data rate, payload size and the number of
stations. These factors combined point to a centralized admission control
whereas for 802.11 DCF it is ideally performed in a distributed manner. The use
of measurements from the channel avoids explicit inputs about the state of the
channel described above. BUFFET, a model based measurement-assisted distributed
admission control scheme for DCF proposed in this paper relies on measurements
to derive model inputs and predict WLAN saturation, thereby maintaining average
delay within acceptable limits. Being measurement based, it adapts to a
combination of data rates and payload sizes, making it completely autonomous
and distributed. Performance analysis using OPNET simulations suggests that
BUFFET is able to ensure average delay under 7ms at a near-optimal throughput.

Voronoi Diagram of Polygonal Chains under the Discrete Fr\'echet Distance
2007-05-19

Bereg,Sergey
Gavrilova,Marina
Zhu,Binhai

Polygonal chains are fundamental objects in many applications like pattern
recognition and protein structure alignment. A well-known measure to
characterize the similarity of two polygonal chains is the famous Fr\`{e}chet
distance. In this paper, for the first time, we consider the Voronoi diagram of
polygonal chains in $d$-dimension ($d=2,3$) under the discrete Fr\`{e}chet
distance. Given $n$ polygonal chains ${\cal C}$ in $d$-dimension ($d=2,3$),
each with at most $k$ vertices, we prove fundamental properties of such a
Voronoi diagram {\em VD}$_F({\cal C})$ by presenting the first known upper and
lower bounds for {\em VD}$_F({\cal C})$.

Capacity of Sparse Multipath Channels in the Ultra-Wideband Regime
2007-05-19

Raghavan,Vasanthan
Hariharan,Gautham
Sayeed,Akbar

This paper studies the ergodic capacity of time- and frequency-selective
multipath fading channels in the ultrawideband (UWB) regime when training
signals are used for channel estimation at the receiver. Motivated by recent
measurement results on UWB channels, we propose a model for sparse multipath
channels. A key implication of sparsity is that the independent degrees of
freedom (DoF) in the channel scale sub-linearly with the signal space dimension
(product of signaling duration and bandwidth). Sparsity is captured by the
number of resolvable paths in delay and Doppler. Our analysis is based on a
training and communication scheme that employs signaling over orthogonal
short-time Fourier (STF) basis functions. STF signaling naturally relates
sparsity in delay-Doppler to coherence in time-frequency. We study the impact
of multipath sparsity on two fundamental metrics of spectral efficiency in the
wideband/low-SNR limit introduced by Verdu: first- and second-order optimality
conditions. Recent results by Zheng et. al. have underscored the large gap in
spectral efficiency between coherent and non-coherent extremes and the
importance of channel learning in bridging the gap. Building on these results,
our results lead to the following implications of multipath sparsity: 1) The
coherence requirements are shared in both time and frequency, thereby
significantly relaxing the required scaling in coherence time with SNR; 2)
Sparse multipath channels are asymptotically coherent -- for a given but large
bandwidth, the channel can be learned perfectly and the coherence requirements
for first- and second-order optimality met through sufficiently large signaling
duration; and 3) The requirement of peaky signals in attaining capacity is
eliminated or relaxed in sparse environments.

Non-Coherent Capacity and Reliability of Sparse Multipath Channels in the Wideband Regime
2007-05-19

Hariharan,Gautham
Sayeed,Akbar

In contrast to the prevalent assumption of rich multipath in information
theoretic analysis of wireless channels, physical channels exhibit sparse
multipath, especially at large bandwidths. We propose a model for sparse
multipath fading channels and present results on the impact of sparsity on
non-coherent capacity and reliability in the wideband regime. A key implication
of sparsity is that the statistically independent degrees of freedom in the
channel, that represent the delay-Doppler diversity afforded by multipath,
scale at a sub-linear rate with the signal space dimension (time-bandwidth
product). Our analysis is based on a training-based communication scheme that
uses short-time Fourier (STF) signaling waveforms. Sparsity in delay-Doppler
manifests itself as time-frequency coherence in the STF domain. From a capacity
perspective, sparse channels are asymptotically coherent: the gap between
coherent and non-coherent extremes vanishes in the limit of large signal space
dimension without the need for peaky signaling. From a reliability viewpoint,
there is a fundamental tradeoff between channel diversity and learnability that
can be optimized to maximize the error exponent at any rate by appropriately
choosing the signaling duration as a function of bandwidth.

Scanning and Sequential Decision Making for Multi-Dimensional Data - Part II: the Noisy Case
2007-05-20

Cohen,Asaf
Weissman,Tsachy
Merhav,Neri

We consider the problem of sequential decision making on random fields
corrupted by noise. In this scenario, the decision maker observes a noisy
version of the data, yet judged with respect to the clean data. In particular,
we first consider the problem of sequentially scanning and filtering noisy
random fields. In this case, the sequential filter is given the freedom to
choose the path over which it traverses the random field (e.g., noisy image or
video sequence), thus it is natural to ask what is the best achievable
performance and how sensitive this performance is to the choice of the scan. We
formally define the problem of scanning and filtering, derive a bound on the
best achievable performance and quantify the excess loss occurring when
non-optimal scanners are used, compared to optimal scanning and filtering.
  We then discuss the problem of sequential scanning and prediction of noisy
random fields. This setting is a natural model for applications such as
restoration and coding of noisy images. We formally define the problem of
scanning and prediction of a noisy multidimensional array and relate the
optimal performance to the clean scandictability defined by Merhav and
Weissman. Moreover, bounds on the excess loss due to sub-optimal scans are
derived, and a universal prediction algorithm is suggested.
  This paper is the second part of a two-part paper. The first paper dealt with
sequential decision making on noiseless data arrays, namely, when the decision
maker is judged with respect to the same data array it observes.

An online algorithm for generating fractal hash chains applied to digital chains of custody
2007-05-20

Bradford,Phillip G.
Ray,Daniel A.

This paper gives an online algorithm for generating Jakobsson's fractal hash
chains. Our new algorithm compliments Jakobsson's fractal hash chain algorithm
for preimage traversal since his algorithm assumes the entire hash chain is
precomputed and a particular list of Ceiling(log n) hash elements or pebbles
are saved. Our online algorithm for hash chain traversal incrementally
generates a hash chain of n hash elements without knowledge of n before it
starts. For any n, our algorithm stores only the Ceiling(log n) pebbles which
are precisely the inputs for Jakobsson's amortized hash chain preimage
traversal algorithm. This compact representation is useful to generate,
traverse, and store a number of large digital hash chains on a small and
constrained device. We also give an application using both Jakobsson's and our
new algorithm applied to digital chains of custody for validating dynamically
changing forensics data.

A stochastic non-cooperative game for energy efficiency in wireless data networks
2007-05-21

Buzzi,Stefano
Poor,H. Vincent
Saturnino,Daniela

In this paper the issue of energy efficiency in CDMA wireless data networks
is addressed through a game theoretic approach. Building on a recent paper by
the first two authors, wherein a non-cooperative game for spreading-code
optimization, power control, and receiver design has been proposed to maximize
the ratio of data throughput to transmit power for each active user, a
stochastic algorithm is here described to perform adaptive implementation of
the said non-cooperative game. The proposed solution is based on a combination
of RLS-type and LMS-type adaptations, and makes use of readily available
measurements. Simulation results show that its performance approaches with
satisfactory accuracy that of the non-adaptive game, which requires a much
larger amount of prior information.

An Extensible Timing Infrastructure for Adaptive Large-scale Applications

Real-time access to accurate and reliable timing information is necessary to
profile scientific applications, and crucial as simulations become increasingly
complex, adaptive, and large-scale. The Cactus Framework provides flexible and
extensible capabilities for timing information through a well designed
infrastructure and timing API. Applications built with Cactus automatically
gain access to built-in timers, such as gettimeofday and getrusage,
system-specific hardware clocks, and high-level interfaces such as PAPI. We
describe the Cactus timer interface, its motivation, and its implementation. We
then demonstrate how this timing information can be used by an example
scientific application to profile itself, and to dynamically adapt itself to a
changing environment at run time.

Spectral Efficiency of Spectrum Pooling Systems
2007-05-21
2010-04-02
Haddad,Majed
Hayar,Aawatif Menouni
Debbah,Merouane

In this contribution, we investigate the idea of using cognitive radio to
reuse locally unused spectrum to increase the total system capacity. We
consider a multiband/wideband system in which the primary and cognitive users
wish to communicate to different receivers, subject to mutual interference and
assume that each user knows only his channel and the unused spectrum through
adequate sensing. The basic idea under the proposed scheme is based on the
notion of spectrum pooling. The idea is quite simple: a cognitive radio will
listen to the channel and, if sensed idle, will transmit during the voids. It
turns out that, although its simplicity, the proposed scheme showed very
interesting features with respect to the spectral efficiency and the maximum
number of possible pairwise cognitive communications. We impose the constraint
that users successively transmit over available bands through selfish water
filling. For the first time, our study has quantified the asymptotic (with
respect to the band) achievable gain of using spectrum pooling in terms of
spectral efficiency compared to classical radio systems. We then derive the
total spectral efficiency as well as the maximum number of possible pairwise
communications of such a spectrum pooling system.

A competitive multi-agent model of interbank payment systems
2007-05-22

Galbiati,Marco
Soramaki,Kimmo

We develop a dynamic multi-agent model of an interbank payment system where
banks choose their level of available funds on the basis of private payoff
maximisation. The model consists of the repetition of a simultaneous move stage
game with incomplete information, incomplete monitoring, and stochastic
payoffs. Adaptation takes place with bayesian updating, with banks maximizing
immediate payoffs. We carry out numerical simulations to solve the model and
investigate two special scenarios: an operational incident and exogenous
throughput guidelines for payment submission. We find that the demand for
intraday credit is an S-shaped function of the cost ratio between intraday
credit costs and the costs associated with delaying payments. We also find that
the demand for liquidity is increased both under operational incidents and in
the presence of effective throughput guidelines.

On the Shannon capacity and queueing stability of random access multicast
2007-05-21
2007-09-19
Shrader,Brooke
Ephremides,Anthony

We study and compare the Shannon capacity region and the stable throughput
region for a random access system in which source nodes multicast their
messages to multiple destination nodes. Under an erasure channel model which
accounts for interference and allows for multipacket reception, we first
characterize the Shannon capacity region. We then consider a queueing-theoretic
formulation and characterize the stable throughput region for two different
transmission policies: a retransmission policy and random linear coding. Our
results indicate that for large blocklengths, the random linear coding policy
provides a higher stable throughput than the retransmission policy.
Furthermore, our results provide an example of a transmission policy for which
the Shannon capacity region strictly outer bounds the stable throughput region,
which contradicts an unproven conjecture that the Shannon capacity and stable
throughput coincide for random access systems.

Measuring and Localing Homology Classes

We develop a method for measuring and localizing homology classes. This
involves two problems. First, we define relevant notions of size for both a
homology class and a homology group basis, using ideas from relative homology.
Second, we propose an algorithm to compute the optimal homology basis, using
techniques from persistent homology and finite field algebra. Classes of the
computed optimal basis are localized with cycles conveying their sizes. The
algorithm runs in $O(\beta^4 n^3 \log^2 n)$ time, where $n$ is the size of the
simplicial complex and $\beta$ is the Betti number of the homology group.

Distortion Minimization in Gaussian Layered Broadcast Coding with Successive Refinement
2007-05-22
2009-06-17
Ng,Chris T. K.
Gunduz,Deniz
Goldsmith,Andrea
Erkip,Elza

A transmitter without channel state information (CSI) wishes to send a
delay-limited Gaussian source over a slowly fading channel. The source is coded
in superimposed layers, with each layer successively refining the description
in the previous one. The receiver decodes the layers that are supported by the
channel realization and reconstructs the source up to a distortion. The
expected distortion is minimized by optimally allocating the transmit power
among the source layers. For two source layers, the allocation is optimal when
power is first assigned to the higher layer up to a power ceiling that depends
only on the channel fading distribution; all remaining power, if any, is
allocated to the lower layer. For convex distortion cost functions with convex
constraints, the minimization is formulated as a convex optimization problem.
In the limit of a continuum of infinite layers, the minimum expected distortion
is given by the solution to a set of linear differential equations in terms of
the density of the fading distribution. As the bandwidth ratio b (channel uses
per source symbol) tends to zero, the power distribution that minimizes
expected distortion converges to the one that maximizes expected capacity.
While expected distortion can be improved by acquiring CSI at the transmitter
(CSIT) or by increasing diversity from the realization of independent fading
paths, at high SNR the performance benefit from diversity exceeds that from
CSIT, especially when b is large.

The class of algorithmically computable simple games (i) includes the class
of games that have finite carriers and (ii) is included in the class of games
that have finite winning coalitions. This paper characterizes computable games,
strengthens the earlier result that computable games violate anonymity, and
gives examples showing that the above inclusions are strict. It also extends
Nakamura's theorem about the nonemptyness of the core and shows that computable
games have a finite Nakamura number, implying that the number of alternatives
that the players can deal with rationally is restricted.

Recovering Multiplexing Loss Through Successive Relaying Using Repetition Coding
2007-05-22

Fan,Yijia
Wang,Chao
Thompson,John
Poor,H. Vincent

In this paper, a transmission protocol is studied for a two relay wireless
network in which simple repetition coding is applied at the relays.
Information-theoretic achievable rates for this transmission scheme are given,
and a space-time V-BLAST signalling and detection method that can approach them
is developed. It is shown through the diversity multiplexing tradeoff analysis
that this transmission scheme can recover the multiplexing loss of the
half-duplex relay network, while retaining some diversity gain. This scheme is
also compared with conventional transmission protocols that exploit only the
diversity of the network at the cost of a multiplexing loss. It is shown that
the new transmission protocol offers significant performance advantages over
conventional protocols, especially when the interference between the two relays
is sufficiently strong.

Acyclicity of Preferences, Nash Equilibria, and Subgame Perfect Equilibria: a Formal and Constructive Equivalence
2007-05-23

Roux,Stéphane Le

In 1953, Kuhn showed that every sequential game has a Nash equilibrium by
showing that a procedure, named ``backward induction'' in game theory, yields a
Nash equilibrium. It actually yields Nash equilibria that define a proper
subclass of Nash equilibria. In 1965, Selten named this proper subclass subgame
perfect equilibria. In game theory, payoffs are rewards usually granted at the
end of a game. Although traditional game theory mainly focuses on real-valued
payoffs that are implicitly ordered by the usual total order over the reals,
works of Simon or Blackwell already involved partially ordered payoffs. This
paper generalises the notion of sequential game by replacing real-valued payoff
functions with abstract atomic objects, called outcomes, and by replacing the
usual total order over the reals with arbitrary binary relations over outcomes,
called preferences. This introduces a general abstract formalism where Nash
equilibrium, subgame perfect equilibrium, and ``backward induction'' can still
be defined. This paper proves that the following three propositions are
equivalent: 1) Preferences over the outcomes are acyclic. 2) Every sequential
game has a Nash equilibrium. 3) Every sequential game has a subgame perfect
equilibrium. The result is fully computer-certified using Coq. Beside the
additional guarantee of correctness, the activity of formalisation using Coq
also helps clearly identify the useful definitions and the main articulations
of the proof.

Multiuser detection in a dynamic environment Part I: User identification and data detection
2007-05-23

Biglieri,Ezio
Lops,Marco

In random-access communication systems, the number of active users varies
with time, and has considerable bearing on receiver's performance. Thus,
techniques aimed at identifying not only the information transmitted, but also
that number, play a central role in those systems. An example of application of
these techniques can be found in multiuser detection (MUD). In typical MUD
analyses, receivers are based on the assumption that the number of active users
is constant and known at the receiver, and coincides with the maximum number of
users entitled to access the system. This assumption is often overly
pessimistic, since many users might be inactive at any given time, and
detection under the assumption of a number of users larger than the real one
may impair performance.
  The main goal of this paper is to introduce a general approach to the problem
of identifying active users and estimating their parameters and data in a
random-access system where users are continuously entering and leaving the
system. The tool whose use we advocate is Random-Set Theory: applying this, we
derive optimum receivers in an environment where the set of transmitters
comprises an unknown number of elements. In addition, we can derive
Bayesian-filter equations which describe the evolution with time of the a
posteriori probability density of the unknown user parameters, and use this
density to derive optimum detectors. In this paper we restrict ourselves to
interferer identification and data detection, while in a companion paper we
shall examine the more complex problem of estimating users' parameters.

Open Access Publishing in Particle Physics: A Brief Introduction for the non-Expert
2007-05-23

Brooks,Travis C.

Open Access to particle physics literature does not sound particularly new or
exciting, since particle physicists have been reading preprints for decades,
and arXiv.org for 15 years. However new movements in Europe are attempting to
make the peer-reviewed literature of the field fully Open Access. This is not a
new movement, nor is it restricted to this field. However, given the field's
history of preprints and eprints, it is well suited to a change to a fully Open
Access publishing model. Data shows that 90% of HEP published literature is
freely available online, meaning that HEP libraries have little need for
expensive journal subscriptions. As libraries begin to cancel journal
subscriptions, the peer review process will lose its primary source of funding.
Open Access publishing models can potentially address this issue. European
physicists and funding agencies are proposing a consortium, SCOAP3, that might
solve many of the objections to traditional Open Access publishing models in
Particle Physics. These proposed changes should be viewed as a starting point
for a serious look at the field's publication model, and are at least worthy of
attention, if not adoption.

Linear Tabling Strategies and Optimizations
2007-05-23

Zhou,Neng-Fa
Sato,Taisuke
Shen,Yi-Dong

Recently, the iterative approach named linear tabling has received
considerable attention because of its simplicity, ease of implementation, and
good space efficiency. Linear tabling is a framework from which different
methods can be derived based on the strategies used in handling looping
subgoals. One decision concerns when answers are consumed and returned. This
paper describes two strategies, namely, {\it lazy} and {\it eager} strategies,
and compares them both qualitatively and quantitatively. The results indicate
that, while the lazy strategy has good locality and is well suited for finding
all solutions, the eager strategy is comparable in speed with the lazy strategy
and is well suited for programs with cuts. Linear tabling relies on depth-first
iterative deepening rather than suspension to compute fixpoints. Each cluster
of inter-dependent subgoals as represented by a top-most looping subgoal is
iteratively evaluated until no subgoal in it can produce any new answers. Naive
re-evaluation of all looping subgoals, albeit simple, may be computationally
unacceptable. In this paper, we also introduce semi-naive optimization, an
effective technique employed in bottom-up evaluation of logic programs to avoid
redundant joins of answers, into linear tabling. We give the conditions for the
technique to be safe (i.e. sound and complete) and propose an optimization
technique called {\it early answer promotion} to enhance its effectiveness.
Benchmarking in B-Prolog demonstrates that with this optimization linear
tabling compares favorably well in speed with the state-of-the-art
implementation of SLG.

Linearly bounded Turing machines have been mainly studied as acceptors for

representing their observable computational behavior, called linearly bounded
graphs. These automata naturally accept the same languages as the linearly
bounded machines defining them. We present some of their structural properties
as well as alternative characterizations in terms of rewriting systems and
context-sensitive transductions. Finally, we compare these graphs to rational
graphs, which are another class of automata accepting the context-sensitive
languages, and prove that in the bounded-degree case, rational graphs are a
strict sub-class of linearly bounded graphs.

Making Random Choices Invisible to the Scheduler
2007-05-24

Chatzikokolakis,Konstantinos
Palamidessi,Catuscia

When dealing with process calculi and automata which express both
nondeterministic and probabilistic behavior, it is customary to introduce the
notion of scheduler to solve the nondeterminism. It has been observed that for
certain applications, notably those in security, the scheduler needs to be
restricted so not to reveal the outcome of the protocol's random choices, or
otherwise the model of adversary would be too strong even for ``obviously
correct'' protocols. We propose a process-algebraic framework in which the
control on the scheduler can be specified in syntactic terms, and we show how
to apply it to solve the problem mentioned above. We also consider the
definition of (probabilistic) may and must preorders, and we show that they are
precongruences with respect to the restricted schedulers. Furthermore, we show
that all the operators of the language, except replication, distribute over
probabilistic summation, which is a useful property for verification.

Multidimensional Coded Modulation in Block-Fading Channnels

Fabregas,Albert Guillen i

We study the problem of constructing coded modulation schemes over
multidimensional signal sets in Nakagami-$m$ block-fading channels. In
particular, we consider the optimal diversity reliability exponent of the error
probability when the multidimensional constellation is obtained as the rotation
of classical complex-plane signal constellations. We show that multidimensional
rotations of full dimension achieve the optimal diversity reliability exponent,
also achieved by Gaussian constellations. Multidimensional rotations of full
dimension induce a large decoding complexity, and in some cases it might be
beneficial to use multiple rotations of smaller dimension. We also study the
diversity reliability exponent in this case, which yields the optimal
rate-diversity-complexity tradeoff in block-fading channels with discrete
inputs.

Generalizing Consistency and other Constraint Properties to Quantified Constraints
2007-05-24

Bordeaux,Lucas
Cadoli,Marco
Mancini,Toni

Quantified constraints and Quantified Boolean Formulae are typically much
more difficult to reason with than classical constraints, because quantifier
alternation makes the usual notion of solution inappropriate. As a consequence,
basic properties of Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP), such as consistency
or substitutability, are not completely understood in the quantified case.
These properties are important because they are the basis of most of the
reasoning methods used to solve classical (existentially quantified)
constraints, and one would like to benefit from similar reasoning methods in
the resolution of quantified constraints. In this paper, we show that most of
the properties that are used by solvers for CSP can be generalized to
quantified CSP. This requires a re-thinking of a number of basic concepts; in
particular, we propose a notion of outcome that generalizes the classical
notion of solution and on which all definitions are based. We propose a
systematic study of the relations which hold between these properties, as well
as complexity results regarding the decision of these properties. Finally, and
since these problems are typically intractable, we generalize the approach used
in CSP and propose weaker, easier to check notions based on locality, which
allow to detect these properties incompletely but in polynomial time.

Subtraction of aligned images is a means to assess changes in a wide variety

origin of Mutual Information (MI), which is based on Shannon's entropy.However,
the interpretation of standard MI registration as a communication channel
suggests that MI is too restrictive a criterion. In this paper the concept of
Mutual Information (MI) is extended to (Normalized) Focussed Mutual Information
(FMI) to incorporate prior knowledge to overcome some shortcomings of MI. We
use this to develop new methodologies to successfully address specific
registration problems, the follow-up of dental restorations, cephalometry, and
the monitoring of implants.

A Logic of Reachable Patterns in Linked Data-Structures

Yorsh,Greta
Rabinovich,Alexander
Sagiv,Mooly
Meyer,Antoine
Bouajjani,Ahmed

We define a new decidable logic for expressing and checking invariants of
programs that manipulate dynamically-allocated objects via pointers and
destructive pointer updates. The main feature of this logic is the ability to
limit the neighborhood of a node that is reachable via a regular expression
from a designated node. The logic is closed under boolean operations
(entailment, negation) and has a finite model property. The key technical
result is the proof of decidability. We show how to express precondition,
postconditions, and loop invariants for some interesting programs. It is also
possible to express properties such as disjointness of data-structures, and
low-level heap mutations. Moreover, our logic can express properties of
arbitrary data-structures and of an arbitrary number of pointer fields. The
latter provides a way to naturally specify postconditions that relate the
fields on entry to a procedure to the fields on exit. Therefore, it is possible
to use the logic to automatically prove partial correctness of programs
performing low-level heap mutations.

co-evolve by exploring a project's versioning system, code coverage reports and
size-metrics. Three open source case studies teach us that testing activities
usually start later on during the lifetime and are more "phased", although we
did not observe increasing testing activity before releases. Furthermore, we
note large differences in the levels of test coverage given the proportion of

Triple-loop networks with arbitrarily many minimum distance diagrams

Minimum distance diagrams are a way to encode the diameter and routing
information of multi-loop networks. For the widely studied case of double-loop

they have a very definite form "L-shape''.

an arbitrarily big number of associated minimum distance diagrams. For doing
this, we build-up on the relations between minimum distance diagrams and
monomial ideals.

Subjective Information Measure and Rate Fidelity Theory
2007-05-24

Lu,Chenguang

Using fish-covering model, this paper intuitively explains how to extend
Hartley's information formula to the generalized information formula step by
step for measuring subjective information: metrical information (such as
conveyed by thermometers), sensory information (such as conveyed by color
vision), and semantic information (such as conveyed by weather forecasts). The
pivotal step is to differentiate condition probability and logical condition
probability of a message. The paper illustrates the rationality of the formula,
discusses the coherence of the generalized information formula and Popper's
knowledge evolution theory. For optimizing data compression, the paper
discusses rate-of-limiting-errors and its similarity to complexity-distortion
based on Kolmogorov's complexity theory, and improves the rate-distortion
theory into the rate-fidelity theory by replacing Shannon's distortion with
subjective mutual information. It is proved that both the rate-distortion
function and the rate-fidelity function are equivalent to a
rate-of-limiting-errors function with a group of fuzzy sets as limiting
condition, and can be expressed by a formula of generalized mutual information
for lossy coding, or by a formula of generalized entropy for lossless coding.
By analyzing the rate-fidelity function related to visual discrimination and
digitized bits of pixels of images, the paper concludes that subjective
information is less than or equal to objective (Shannon's) information; there
is an optimal matching point at which two kinds of information are equal; the
matching information increases with visual discrimination (defined by confusing
probability) rising; for given visual discrimination, too high resolution of
images or too much objective information is wasteful.

Structural Health Monitoring Using Neural Network Based Vibrational System Identification
2007-05-24

Sofge,Donald A.

Composite fabrication technologies now provide the means for producing
high-strength, low-weight panels, plates, spars and other structural components
which use embedded fiber optic sensors and piezoelectric transducers. These
materials, often referred to as smart structures, make it possible to sense
internal characteristics, such as delaminations or structural degradation. In
this effort we use neural network based techniques for modeling and analyzing
dynamic structural information for recognizing structural defects. This yields
an adaptable system which gives a measure of structural integrity for composite
structures.

Distributed Transmit Diversity in Relay Networks

We analyze fading relay networks, where a single-antenna source-destination
terminal pair communicates through a set of half-duplex single-antenna relays
using a two-hop protocol with linear processing at the relay level. A family of
relaying schemes is presented which achieves the entire optimal
diversity-multiplexing (DM) tradeoff curve. As a byproduct of our analysis, it
follows that delay diversity and phase-rolling at the relay level are optimal
with respect to the entire DM-tradeoff curve, provided the delays and the
modulation frequencies, respectively, are chosen appropriately.

Power-Efficient Direct-Voting Assurance for Data Fusion in Wireless Sensor Networks
2007-05-24

Pai,H. -T.
Han,Y. S.

Wireless sensor networks place sensors into an area to collect data and send
them back to a base station. Data fusion, which fuses the collected data before
they are sent to the base station, is usually implemented over the network.
Since the sensor is typically placed in locations accessible to malicious
attackers, information assurance of the data fusion process is very important.
A witness-based approach has been proposed to validate the fusion data. In this
approach, the base station receives the fusion data and "votes" on the data
from a randomly chosen sensor node. The vote comes from other sensor nodes,
called "witnesses," to verify the correctness of the fusion data. Because the
base station obtains the vote through the chosen node, the chosen node could
forge the vote if it is compromised. Thus, the witness node must encrypt the
vote to prevent this forgery. Compared with the vote, the encryption requires
more bits, increasing transmission burden from the chosen node to the base
station. The chosen node consumes more power. This work improves the
witness-based approach using direct voting mechanism such that the proposed
scheme has better performance in terms of assurance, overhead, and delay. The
witness node transmits the vote directly to the base station. Forgery is not a
problem in this scheme. Moreover, fewer bits are necessary to represent the
vote, significantly reducing the power consumption. Performance analysis and
simulation results indicate that the proposed approach can achieve a 40 times
better overhead than the witness-based approach.

Morphing Ensemble Kalman Filters
2007-05-25
2007-08-23
Beezley,Jonathan D.
Mandel,Jan

A new type of ensemble filter is proposed, which combines an ensemble Kalman
filter (EnKF) with the ideas of morphing and registration from image
processing. This results in filters suitable for nonlinear problems whose
solutions exhibit moving coherent features, such as thin interfaces in wildfire
modeling. The ensemble members are represented as the composition of one common
state with a spatial transformation, called registration mapping, plus a
residual. A fully automatic registration method is used that requires only
gridded data, so the features in the model state do not need to be identified
by the user. The morphing EnKF operates on a transformed state consisting of
the registration mapping and the residual. Essentially, the morphing EnKF uses
intermediate states obtained by morphing instead of linear combinations of the
states.

results near the theoretical limits. In particular, we experiment our
techniques on the Iris Challenge Evaluation (ICE) database and validate our

On the Obfuscation Complexity of Planar Graphs
2007-05-25
2007-12-14
Verbitsky,Oleg

Being motivated by John Tantalo's Planarity Game, we consider straight line
plane drawings of a planar graph $G$ with edge crossings and wonder how
obfuscated such drawings can be. We define $obf(G)$, the obfuscation complexity
of $G$, to be the maximum number of edge crossings in a drawing of $G$.
Relating $obf(G)$ to the distribution of vertex degrees in $G$, we show an
efficient way of constructing a drawing of $G$ with at least $obf(G)/3$ edge
crossings. We prove bounds $(\delta(G)^2/24-o(1))n^2 < \obf G <3 n^2$ for an
$n$-vertex planar graph $G$ with minimum vertex degree $\delta(G)\ge 2$.
  The shift complexity of $G$, denoted by $shift(G)$, is the minimum number of
vertex shifts sufficient to eliminate all edge crossings in an arbitrarily
obfuscated drawing of $G$ (after shifting a vertex, all incident edges are
supposed to be redrawn correspondingly). If $\delta(G)\ge 3$, then $shift(G)$
is linear in the number of vertices due to the known fact that the matching
number of $G$ is linear. However, in the case $\delta(G)\ge2$ we notice that
$shift(G)$ can be linear even if the matching number is bounded. As for
computational complexity, we show that, given a drawing $D$ of a planar graph,
it is NP-hard to find an optimum sequence of shifts making $D$ crossing-free.

On the expressive power of planar perfect matching and permanents of bounded treewidth matrices
2007-05-25

Lyaudet,Laurent
Koiran,Pascal
Flarup,Uffe

Valiant introduced some 25 years ago an algebraic model of computation along
with the complexity classes VP and VNP, which can be viewed as analogues of the
classical classes P and NP. They are defined using non-uniform sequences of
arithmetic circuits and provides a framework to study the complexity for
sequences of polynomials. Prominent examples of difficult (that is,
VNP-complete) problems in this model includes the permanent and hamiltonian
polynomials. While the permanent and hamiltonian polynomials in general are
difficult to evaluate, there have been research on which special cases of these
polynomials admits efficient evaluation. For instance, Barvinok has shown that
if the underlying matrix has bounded rank, both the permanent and the
hamiltonian polynomials can be evaluated in polynomial time, and thus are in
VP. Courcelle, Makowsky and Rotics have shown that for matrices of bounded
treewidth several difficult problems (including evaluating the permanent and
hamiltonian polynomials) can be solved efficiently. An earlier result of this
flavour is Kasteleyn's theorem which states that the sum of weights of perfect
matchings of a planar graph can be computed in polynomial time, and thus is in
VP also. For general graphs this problem is VNP-complete. In this paper we
investigate the expressive power of the above results. We show that the
permanent and hamiltonian polynomials for matrices of bounded treewidth both
are equivalent to arithmetic formulas. Also, arithmetic weakly skew circuits
are shown to be equivalent to the sum of weights of perfect matchings of planar
graphs.

On complexity of optimized crossover for binary representations

Eremeev,Anton

We consider the computational complexity of producing the best possible
offspring in a crossover, given two solutions of the parents. The crossover
operators are studied on the class of Boolean linear programming problems,
where the Boolean vector of variables is used as the solution representation.
By means of efficient reductions of the optimized gene transmitting crossover
problems (OGTC) we show the polynomial solvability of the OGTC for the maximum
weight set packing problem, the minimum weight set partition problem and for
one of the versions of the simple plant location problem. We study a connection
between the OGTC for linear Boolean programming problem and the maximum weight
independent set problem on 2-colorable hypergraph and prove the NP-hardness of
several special cases of the OGTC problem in Boolean linear programming.

Let $G=(S, E)$ be a plane straight-line graph on a finite point set
$S\subset\R^2$ in general position. The incident angles of a vertex $p \in S$
of $G$ are the angles between any two edges of $G$ that appear consecutively in
the circular order of the edges incident to $p$.
  A plane straight-line graph is called $\phi$-open if each vertex has an
incident angle of size at least $\phi$. In this paper we study the following
type of question: What is the maximum angle $\phi$ such that for any finite set
$S\subset\R^2$ of points in general position we can find a graph from a certain
class of graphs on $S$ that is $\phi$-open? In particular, we consider the
classes of triangulations, spanning trees, and paths on $S$ and give tight
bounds in most cases.

Symbolic Reachability Analysis of Higher-Order Context-Free Processes
2007-05-28

Bouajjani,Ahmed
Meyer,Antoine

We consider the problem of symbolic reachability analysis of higher-order
context-free processes. These models are generalizations of the context-free
processes (also called BPA processes) where each process manipulates a data
structure which can be seen as a nested stack of stacks. Our main result is
that, for any higher-order context-free process, the set of all predecessors of
a given regular set of configurations is regular and effectively constructible.
This result generalizes the analogous result which is known for level 1
context-free processes. We show that this result holds also in the case of
backward reachability analysis under a regular constraint on configurations. As
a corollary, we obtain a symbolic model checking algorithm for the temporal
logic E(U,X) with regular atomic predicates, i.e., the fragment of CTL
restricted to the EU and EX modalities.

Towards Understanding the Origin of Genetic Languages

Molecular biology is a nanotechnology that works--it has worked for billions
of years and in an amazing variety of circumstances. At its core is a system
for acquiring, processing and communicating information that is universal, from
viruses and bacteria to human beings. Advances in genetics and experience in
designing computers have taken us to a stage where we can understand the
optimisation principles at the root of this system, from the availability of
basic building blocks to the execution of tasks. The languages of DNA and
proteins are argued to be the optimal solutions to the information processing
tasks they carry out. The analysis also suggests simpler predecessors to these
languages, and provides fascinating clues about their origin. Obviously, a
comprehensive unraveling of the puzzle of life would have a lot to say about
what we may design or convert ourselves into.

Interior Point Decoding for Linear Vector Channels
2007-05-27
2008-04-08
Wadayama,Tadashi

In this paper, a novel decoding algorithm for low-density parity-check (LDPC)
codes based on convex optimization is presented. The decoding algorithm, called
interior point decoding, is designed for linear vector channels. The linear
vector channels include many practically important channels such as inter
symbol interference channels and partial response channels. It is shown that
the maximum likelihood decoding (MLD) rule for a linear vector channel can be
relaxed to a convex optimization problem, which is called a relaxed MLD
problem. The proposed decoding algorithm is based on a numerical optimization
technique so called interior point method with barrier function. Approximate
variations of the gradient descent and the Newton methods are used to solve the
convex optimization problem. In a decoding process of the proposed algorithm, a
search point always lies in the fundamental polytope defined based on a
low-density parity-check matrix. Compared with a convectional joint message
passing decoder, the proposed decoding algorithm achieves better BER
performance with less complexity in the case of partial response channels in
many cases.

Average Stopping Set Weight Distribution of Redundant Random Matrix Ensembles
2007-05-27

Wadayama,Tadashi

In this paper, redundant random matrix ensembles (abbreviated as redundant
random ensembles) are defined and their stopping set (SS) weight distributions
are analyzed. A redundant random ensemble consists of a set of binary matrices
with linearly dependent rows. These linearly dependent rows (redundant rows)
significantly reduce the number of stopping sets of small size. An upper and
lower bound on the average SS weight distribution of the redundant random
ensembles are shown. From these bounds, the trade-off between the number of
redundant rows (corresponding to decoding complexity of BP on BEC) and the
critical exponent of the asymptotic growth rate of SS weight distribution
(corresponding to decoding performance) can be derived. It is shown that, in
some cases, a dense matrix with linearly dependent rows yields asymptotically
(i.e., in the regime of small erasure probability) better performance than
regular LDPC matrices with comparable parameters.

In this paper, an analysis of the undetected error probability of ensembles
of binary matrices is presented. The ensemble called the Bernoulli ensemble
whose members are considered as matrices generated from i.i.d. Bernoulli source
is mainly considered here. The main contributions of this work are (i)
derivation of the error exponent of the average undetected error probability
and (ii) closed form expressions for the variance of the undetected error
probability. It is shown that the behavior of the exponent for a sparse
ensemble is somewhat different from that for a dense ensemble. Furthermore, as
a byproduct of the proof of the variance formula, simple covariance formula of
the weight distribution is derived.

The use of the logarithm of the variate in the calculation of differential entropy among certain related statistical distributions
2007-05-28
2009-01-25
Eccardt,Thomas M.

This paper demonstrates that basic statistics (mean, variance) of the
logarithm of the variate itself can be used in the calculation of differential
entropy among random variables known to be multiples and powers of a common
underlying variate. For the same set of distributions, the variance of the
differential self-information is shown also to be a function of statistics of
the logarithmic variate. Then entropy and its "variance" can be estimated using
only statistics of the logarithmic variate plus constants, without reference to
the traditional parameters of the variate.

On Term Rewriting Systems Having a Rational Derivation
2007-05-28

Meyer,Antoine

Several types of term rewriting systems can be distinguished by the way their
rules overlap. In particular, we define the classes of prefix, suffix,
bottom-up and top-down systems, which generalize similar classes on words. Our
aim is to study the derivation relation of such systems (i.e. the reflexive and
transitive closure of their rewriting relation) and, if possible, to provide a
finite mechanism characterizing it. Using a notion of rational relations based
on finite graph grammars, we show that the derivation of any bottom-up,
top-down or suffix systems is rational, while it can be non recursive for
prefix systems.

We demonstrate relationships between the classic Euclidean algorithm and many
other fields of study, particularly in the context of music and distance
geometry. Specifically, we show how the structure of the Euclidean algorithm
defines a family of rhythms which encompass over forty timelines
(\emph{ostinatos}) from traditional world music. We prove that these
\emph{Euclidean rhythms} have the mathematical property that their onset
patterns are distributed as evenly as possible: they maximize the sum of the
Euclidean distances between all pairs of onsets, viewing onsets as points on a
circle. Indeed, Euclidean rhythms are the unique rhythms that maximize this
notion of \emph{evenness}. We also show that essentially all Euclidean rhythms
are \emph{deep}: each distinct distance between onsets occurs with a unique
multiplicity, and these multiplicies form an interval $1,2,...,k-1$. Finally,
we characterize all deep rhythms, showing that they form a subclass of
generated rhythms, which in turn proves a useful property called shelling. All
of our results for musical rhythms apply equally well to musical scales. In
addition, many of the problems we explore are interesting in their own right as
distance geometry problems on the circle; some of the same problems were
explored by Erd\H{o}s in the plane.

A model of providing service in a P2P network is analyzed. It is shown that
by adding a scrip system, a mechanism that admits a reasonable Nash equilibrium
that reduces free riding can be obtained. The effect of varying the total
amount of money (scrip) in the system on efficiency (i.e., social welfare) is
analyzed, and it is shown that by maintaining the appropriate ratio between the
total amount of money and the number of agents, efficiency is maximized. The
work has implications for many online systems, not only P2P networks but also a
wide variety of online forums for which scrip systems are popular, but formal
analyses have been lacking.

Optimizing Scrip Systems: Efficiency, Crashes, Hoarders, and Altruists

Friedman,Eric J.
Halpern,Joseph Y.

We discuss the design of efficient scrip systems and develop tools for
empirically analyzing them. For those interested in the empirical study of
scrip systems, we demonstrate how characteristics of agents in a system can be
inferred from the equilibrium distribution of money. From the perspective of a
system designer, we examine the effect of the money supply on social welfare
and show that social welfare is maximized by increasing the money supply up to
the point that the system experiences a ``monetary crash,'' where money is
sufficiently devalued that no agent is willing to perform a service. We also
examine the implications of the presence of altruists and hoarders on the
performance of the system. While a small number of altruists may improve social
welfare, too many can also cause the system to experience a monetary crash,
which may be bad for social welfare. Hoarders generally decrease social welfare
but, surprisingly, they also promote system stability by helping prevent
monetary crashes. In addition, we provide new technical tools for analyzing and
computing equilibria by showing that our model exhibits strategic
complementarities, which implies that there exist equilibria in pure strategies
that can be computed efficiently.

Secure Two-party Protocols for Point Inclusion Problem

It is well known that, in theory, the general secure multi-party computation
problem is solvable using circuit evaluation protocols. However, the
communication complexity of the resulting protocols depend on the size of the
circuit that expresses the functionality to be computed and hence can be
impractical. Hence special solutions are needed for specific problems for
efficiency reasons. The point inclusion problem in computational geometry is a
special multiparty computation and has got many applications. Previous
protocols for the secure point inclusion problem are not adequate. In this
paper we modify some known solutions to the point inclusion problem in
computational geometry to the frame work of secure two-party computation.

Second-Order Type Isomorphisms Through Game Semantics
2007-05-29

De Lataillade,Joachim

The characterization of second-order type isomorphisms is a purely
syntactical problem that we propose to study under the enlightenment of game
semantics. We study this question in the case of second-order
&#955;$\mu$-calculus, which can be seen as an extension of system F to
classical logic, and for which we de&#64257;ne a categorical framework: control
hyperdoctrines. Our game model of &#955;$\mu$-calculus is based on polymorphic
arenas (closely related to Hughes' hyperforests) which evolve during the play
(following the ideas of Murawski-Ong). We show that type isomorphisms coincide
with the "equality" on arenas associated with types. Finally we deduce the
equational characterization of type isomorphisms from this equality. We also
recover from the same model Roberto Di Cosmo's characterization of type
isomorphisms for system F. This approach leads to a geometrical comprehension
on the question of second order type isomorphisms, which can be easily extended
to some other polymorphic calculi including additional programming features.

Curry-style type Isomorphisms and Game Semantics

De Lataillade,Joachim

Curry-style system F, ie. system F with no explicit types in terms, can be
seen as a core presentation of polymorphism from the point of view of
programming languages. This paper gives a characterisation of type isomorphisms
for this language, by using a game model whose intuitions come both from the
syntax and from the game semantics universe. The model is composed of: an
untyped part to interpret terms, a notion of game to interpret types, and a
typed part to express the fact that an untyped strategy plays on a game. By
analysing isomorphisms in the model, we prove that the equational system
corresponding to type isomorphisms for Curry-style system F is the extension of
the equational system for Church-style isomorphisms with a new, non-trivial
equation: forall X.A = A[forall Y.Y/X] if X appears only positively in A.

Truecluster matching
2007-05-29

Oehlschlägel,Jens

Cluster matching by permuting cluster labels is important in many clustering
contexts such as cluster validation and cluster ensemble techniques. The
classic approach is to minimize the euclidean distance between two cluster
solutions which induces inappropriate stability in certain settings. Therefore,
we present the truematch algorithm that introduces two improvements best
explained in the crisp case. First, instead of maximizing the trace of the
cluster crosstable, we propose to maximize a chi-square transformation of this
crosstable. Thus, the trace will not be dominated by the cells with the largest
counts but by the cells with the most non-random observations, taking into
account the marginals. Second, we suggest a probabilistic component in order to
break ties and to make the matching algorithm truly random on random data. The
truematch algorithm is designed as a building block of the truecluster
framework and scales in polynomial time. First simulation results confirm that
the truematch algorithm gives more consistent truecluster results for unequal
cluster sizes. Free R software is available.

We present a CAD framework for CMOL, a hybrid CMOS/ molecular circuit

based on AND/OR/NOT gates to a NOR gate circuit, and then maps the NOR gates to
CMOL. We encode the CMOL cell assignment problem as boolean conditions. The
boolean constraint is satisfiable if and only if there is a way to map all the
NOR gates to the CMOL cells. We further investigate various types of static
defects for the CMOL architecture, and propose a reconfiguration technique that
can deal with these defects through our CAD framework. This is the first
automated framework for CMOL cell assignment, and the first to model several
different CMOL static defects. Empirical results show that our approach is
efficient and scalable.

PERCEVAL: a Computer-Driven System for Experimentation on Auditory and Visual Perception

Since perception tests are highly time-consuming, there is a need to automate
as many operations as possible, such as stimulus generation, procedure control,
perception testing, and data analysis. The computer-driven system we are
presenting here meets these objectives. To achieve large flexibility, the tests
are controlled by scripts. The system's core software resembles that of a
lexical-syntactic analyzer, which reads and interprets script files sent to it.
The execution sequence (trial) is modified in accordance with the commands and
data received. This type of operation provides a great deal of flexibility and
supports a wide variety of tests such as auditory-lexical decision making,
phoneme monitoring, gating, phonetic categorization, word identification, voice
quality, etc. To achieve good performance, we were careful about timing
accuracy, which is the greatest problem in computerized perception tests.

Uncertain information is commonplace in real-world data management scenarios.
The ability to represent large sets of possible instances (worlds) while
supporting efficient storage and processing is an important challenge in this
context. The recent formalism of world-set decompositions (WSDs) provides a
space-efficient representation for uncertain data that also supports scalable
processing. WSDs are complete for finite world-sets in that they can represent
any finite set of possible worlds. For possibly infinite world-sets, we show
that a natural generalization of WSDs precisely captures the expressive power
of c-tables. We then show that several important decision problems are
efficiently solvable on WSDs while they are NP-hard on c-tables. Finally, we
give a polynomial-time algorithm for factorizing WSDs, i.e. an efficient
algorithm for minimizing such representations.

Mixed membership stochastic blockmodels

Observations consisting of measurements on relationships for pairs of objects
arise in many settings, such as protein interaction and gene regulatory
networks, collections of author-recipient email, and social networks. Analyzing
such data with probabilisic models can be delicate because the simple
exchangeability assumptions underlying many boilerplate models no longer hold.
In this paper, we describe a latent variable model of such data called the
mixed membership stochastic blockmodel. This model extends blockmodels for
relational data to ones which capture mixed membership latent relational
structure, thus providing an object-specific low-dimensional representation. We
develop a general variational inference algorithm for fast approximate
posterior inference. We explore applications to social and protein interaction
networks.

2007-05-31

Wemmenhove,Bastian
Kappen,Bert

In this paper we derive the equations for Loop Corrected Belief Propagation
on a continuous variable Gaussian model. Using the exactness of the averages
for belief propagation for Gaussian models, a different way of obtaining the
covariances is found, based on Belief Propagation on cavity graphs. We discuss
the relation of this loop correction algorithm to Expectation Propagation
algorithms for the case in which the model is no longer Gaussian, but slightly
perturbed by nonlinear terms.

Modeling Epidemic Spread in Synthetic Populations - Virtual Plagues in Massively Multiplayer Online Games
2007-05-31

Boman,Magnus
Johansson,Stefan J.

A virtual plague is a process in which a behavior-affecting property spreads
among characters in a Massively Multiplayer Online Game (MMOG). The MMOG
individuals constitute a synthetic population, and the game can be seen as a
form of interactive executable model for studying disease spread, albeit of a
very special kind. To a game developer maintaining an MMOG, recognizing,
monitoring, and ultimately controlling a virtual plague is important,
regardless of how it was initiated. The prospect of using tools, methods and
theory from the field of epidemiology to do this seems natural and appealing.
We will address the feasibility of such a prospect, first by considering some
basic measures used in epidemiology, then by pointing out the differences
between real world epidemics and virtual plagues. We also suggest directions
for MMOG developer control through epidemiological modeling. Our aim is
understanding the properties of virtual plagues, rather than trying to
eliminate them or mitigate their effects, as would be in the case of real
infectious disease.

Temporal Runtime Verification using Monadic Difference Logic
2007-05-31

Andersen,Henrik Reif
Kristoffersen,Kaare J.

In this paper we present an algorithm for performing runtime verification of
a bounded temporal logic over timed runs. The algorithm consists of three
elements. First, the bounded temporal formula to be verified is translated into
a monadic first-order logic over difference inequalities, which we call monadic
difference logic. Second, at each step of the timed run, the monadic difference
formula is modified by computing a quotient with the state and time of that
step. Third, the resulting formula is checked for being a tautology or being
unsatisfiable by a decision procedure for monadic difference logic.
  We further provide a simple decision procedure for monadic difference logic
based on the data structure Difference Decision Diagrams. The algorithm is
complete in a very strong sense on a subclass of temporal formulae
characterized as homogeneously monadic and it is approximate on other formulae.
The approximation comes from the fact that not all unsatisfiable or
tautological formulae are recognised at the earliest possible time of the
runtime verification.
  Contrary to existing approaches, the presented algorithms do not work by
syntactic rewriting but employ efficient decision structures which make them
applicable in real applications within for instance business software.

Dynamic User-Defined Similarity Searching in Semi-Structured Text Retrieval
2007-05-31

Geraci,Filippo
Pellegrini,Marco

Modern text retrieval systems often provide a similarity search utility, that
allows the user to find efficiently a fixed number k of documents in the data
set that are most similar to a given query (here a query is either a simple
sequence of keywords or the identifier of a full document found in previous
searches that is considered of interest). We consider the case of a textual
database made of semi-structured documents. Each field, in turns, is modelled
with a specific vector space. The problem is more complex when we also allow
each such vector space to have an associated user-defined dynamic weight that
influences its contribution to the overall dynamic aggregated and weighted
similarity. This dynamic problem has been tackled in a recent paper by
Singitham et al. in in VLDB 2004. Their proposed solution, which we take as
baseline, is a variant of the cluster-pruning technique that has the potential
for scaling to very large corpora of documents, and is far more efficient than
the naive exhaustive search. We devise an alternative way of embedding weights
in the data structure, coupled with a non-trivial application of a clustering
algorithm based on the furthest point first heuristic for the metric k-center
problem. The validity of our approach is demonstrated experimentally by showing
significant performance improvements over the scheme proposed in Singitham et
al. in VLDB 2004. We improve significantly tradeoffs between query time and
output quality with respect to the baseline method in Singitham et al. in in
VLDB 2004, and also with respect to a novel method by Chierichetti et al. to
appear in ACM PODS 2007. We also speed up the pre-processing time by a factor
at least thirty.

An Improved Tight Closure Algorithm for Integer Octagonal Constraints
2007-05-31
2007-06-01
Bagnara,Roberto
Hill,Patricia M.
Zaffanella,Enea

Integer octagonal constraints (a.k.a. ``Unit Two Variables Per Inequality''
or ``UTVPI integer constraints'') constitute an interesting class of
constraints for the representation and solution of integer problems in the
fields of constraint programming and formal analysis and verification of
software and hardware systems, since they couple algorithms having polynomial
complexity with a relatively good expressive power. The main algorithms
required for the manipulation of such constraints are the satisfiability check
and the computation of the inferential closure of a set of constraints. The
latter is called `tight' closure to mark the difference with the (incomplete)
closure algorithm that does not exploit the integrality of the variables. In
this paper we present and fully justify an O(n^3) algorithm to compute the
tight closure of a set of UTVPI integer constraints.

Local Area Damage Detection in Composite Structures Using Piezoelectric Transducers
2007-05-31

Lichtenwalner,Peter F.
Sofge,Donald A.

An integrated and automated smart structures approach for structural health
monitoring is presented, utilizing an array of piezoelectric transducers
attached to or embedded within the structure for both actuation and sensing.
The system actively interrogates the structure via broadband excitation of
multiple actuators across a desired frequency range. The structure's vibration
signature is then characterized by computing the transfer functions between
each actuator/sensor pair, and compared to the baseline signature. Experimental
results applying the system to local area damage detection in a MD Explorer
rotorcraft composite flexbeam are presented.

Two sources are better than one for increasing the Kolmogorov complexity of infinite sequences
2007-05-31
2007-12-11
Zimand,Marius

The randomness rate of an infinite binary sequence is characterized by the
sequence of ratios between the Kolmogorov complexity and the length of the
initial segments of the sequence. It is known that there is no uniform
effective procedure that transforms one input sequence into another sequence
with higher randomness rate. By contrast, we display such a uniform effective
procedure having as input two independent sequences with positive but
arbitrarily small constant randomness rate. Moreover the transformation is a
truth-table reduction and the output has randomness rate arbitrarily close to
1.

A randomized algorithm for the on-line weighted bipartite matching problem
2007-05-31
2007-06-06
Csaba,Béla
Pluhár,András S.

We study the on-line minimum weighted bipartite matching problem in arbitrary
metric spaces. Here, $n$ not necessary disjoint points of a metric space $M$
are given, and are to be matched on-line with $n$ points of $M$ revealed one by
one. The cost of a matching is the sum of the distances of the matched points,
and the goal is to find or approximate its minimum. The competitive ratio of
the deterministic problem is known to be $\Theta(n)$. It was conjectured that a
randomized algorithm may perform better against an oblivious adversary, namely
with an expected competitive ratio $\Theta(\log n)$. We prove a slightly weaker
result by showing a $o(\log^3 n)$ upper bound on the expected competitive
ratio. As an application the same upper bound holds for the notoriously hard
fire station problem, where $M$ is the real line.

Recursive n-gram hashing is pairwise independent, at best
2007-05-31
2016-06-06
Lemire,Daniel
Kaser,Owen

Many applications use sequences of n consecutive symbols (n-grams). Hashing
these n-grams can be a performance bottleneck. For more speed, recursive hash
families compute hash values by updating previous values. We prove that
recursive hash families cannot be more than pairwise independent. While hashing
by irreducible polynomials is pairwise independent, our implementations either
run in time O(n) or use an exponential amount of memory. As a more scalable
alternative, we make hashing by cyclic polynomials pairwise independent by
ignoring n-1 bits. Experimentally, we show that hashing by cyclic polynomials
is is twice as fast as hashing by irreducible polynomials. We also show that
randomized Karp-Rabin hash families are not pairwise independent.

Towards an exact adaptive algorithm for the determinant of a rational matrix
2007-05-31

Urbanska,Anna

In this paper we propose several strategies for the exact computation of the
determinant of a rational matrix. First, we use the Chinese Remaindering
Theorem and the rational reconstruction to recover the rational determinant
from its modular images. Then we show a preconditioning for the determinant
which allows us to skip the rational reconstruction process and reconstruct an
integer result. We compare those approaches with matrix preconditioning which
allow us to treat integer instead of rational matrices. This allows us to
introduce integer determinant algorithms to the rational determinant problem.
In particular, we discuss the applicability of the adaptive determinant
algorithm of [9] and compare it with the integer Chinese Remaindering scheme.
We present an analysis of the complexity of the strategies and evaluate their
experimental performance on numerous examples. This experience allows us to
develop an adaptive strategy which would choose the best solution at the run
time, depending on matrix properties. All strategies have been implemented in
LinBox linear algebra library.

Modeling Computations in a Semantic Network
2007-05-31

Rodriguez,Marko A.
Bollen,Johan

Semantic network research has seen a resurgence from its early history in the
cognitive sciences with the inception of the Semantic Web initiative. The
Semantic Web effort has brought forth an array of technologies that support the
encoding, storage, and querying of the semantic network data structure at the
world stage. Currently, the popular conception of the Semantic Web is that of a
data modeling medium where real and conceptual entities are related in
semantically meaningful ways. However, new models have emerged that explicitly
encode procedural information within the semantic network substrate. With these
new technologies, the Semantic Web has evolved from a data modeling medium to a
computational medium. This article provides a classification of existing
computational modeling efforts and the requirements of supporting technologies
that will aid in the further growth of this burgeoning domain.

Symmetry Partition Sort
2007-05-31

Chen,Jing-Chao

In this paper, we propose a useful replacement for quicksort-style utility
functions. The replacement is called Symmetry Partition Sort, which has
essentially the same principle as Proportion Extend Sort. The maximal
difference between them is that the new algorithm always places already
partially sorted inputs (used as a basis for the proportional extension) on
both ends when entering the partition routine. This is advantageous to speeding
up the partition routine. The library function based on the new algorithm is
more attractive than Psort which is a library function introduced in 2004. Its
implementation mechanism is simple. The source code is clearer. The speed is
faster, with O(n log n) performance guarantee. Both the robustness and
adaptivity are better. As a library function, it is competitive.

Many concepts and two logics of algorithmic reduction
2007-06-01
2008-10-12
Japaridze,Giorgi

Within the program of finding axiomatizations for various parts of
computability logic, it was proved earlier that the logic of interactive Turing
reduction is exactly the implicative fragment of Heyting's intuitionistic
calculus. That sort of reduction permits unlimited reusage of the computational
resource represented by the antecedent. An at least equally basic and natural
sort of algorithmic reduction, however, is the one that does not allow such
reusage. The present article shows that turning the logic of the first sort of
reduction into the logic of the second sort of reduction takes nothing more
than just deleting the contraction rule from its Gentzen-style axiomatization.
The first (Turing) sort of interactive reduction is also shown to come in three
natural versions. While those three versions are very different from each
other, their logical behaviors (in isolation) turn out to be indistinguishable,
with that common behavior being precisely captured by implicative
intuitionistic logic. Among the other contributions of the present article is
an informal introduction of a series of new -- finite and bounded -- versions
of recurrence operations and the associated reduction operations. An online
source on computability logic can be found at

On the End-to-End Distortion for a Buffered Transmission over Fading Channel
2007-06-01

Li,Qiang
Georghiades,C. N.

In this paper, we study the end-to-end distortion/delay tradeoff for a
analogue source transmitted over a fading channel. The analogue source is
quantized and stored in a buffer until it is transmitted. There are two extreme
cases as far as buffer delay is concerned: no delay and infinite delay. We
observe that there is a significant power gain by introducing a buffer delay.
Our goal is to investigate the situation between these two extremes. Using
recently proposed \emph{effective capacity} concept, we derive a closed-form
formula for this tradeoff. For SISO case, an asymptotically tight upper bound
for our distortion-delay curve is derived, which approaches to the infinite
delay lower bound as $\mathcal{D}_\infty \exp(\frac{C}{\tau_n})$, with $\tau_n$
is the normalized delay, $C$ is a constant. For more general MIMO channel, we
computed the distortion SNR exponent -- the exponential decay rate of the
expected distortion in the high SNR regime. Numerical results demonstrate that
introduction of a small amount delay can save significant transmission power.

Watermark Embedding and Detection
2007-06-02

Zhong,Jidong

The embedder and the detector (or decoder) are the two most important
components of the digital watermarking systems. Thus in this work, we discuss
how to design a better embedder and detector (or decoder). I first give a
summary of the prospective applications of watermarking technology and major
watermarking schemes in the literature. My review on the literature closely
centers upon how the side information is exploited at both embedders and
detectors. In Chapter 3, I explore the optimum detector or decoder according to
a particular probability distribution of the host signals. We found that the
performance of both multiplicative and additive spread spectrum schemes depends
on the shape parameter of the host signals. For spread spectrum schemes, the
performance of the detector or the decoder is reduced by the host interference.
Thus I present a new host-interference rejection technique for the
multiplicative spread spectrum schemes. Its embedding rule is tailored to the
optimum detection or decoding rule. Though the host interference rejection
schemes enjoy a big performance gain over the traditional spread spectrum
schemes, their drawbacks that it is difficult for them to be implemented with
the perceptual analysis to achieve the maximum allowable embedding level
discourage their use in real scenarios. Thus, in the last chapters of this
work, I introduce a double-sided technique to tackle this drawback. It differs
from the host interference rejection schemes in that it utilizes but does not
reject the host interference at its embedder. The perceptual analysis can be
easily implemented in our scheme to achieve the maximum allowable level of
embedding strength.

Anonymity in the Wild: Mixes on unstructured networks
2007-06-04

Nagaraja,Shishir

As decentralized computing scenarios get ever more popular, unstructured
topologies are natural candidates to consider running mix networks upon. We
consider mix network topologies where mixes are placed on the nodes of an
unstructured network, such as social networks and scale-free random networks.
We explore the efficiency and traffic analysis resistance properties of mix
networks based on unstructured topologies as opposed to theoretically optimal
structured topologies, under high latency conditions. We consider a mix of
directed and undirected network models, as well as one real world case study --
the LiveJournal friendship network topology. Our analysis indicates that
mix-networks based on scale-free and small-world topologies have, firstly,
mix-route lengths that are roughly comparable to those in expander graphs;
second, that compromise of the most central nodes has little effect on
anonymization properties, and third, batch sizes required for warding off
intersection attacks need to be an order of magnitude higher in unstructured
networks in comparison with expander graph topologies.

Abstract numeration systems on bounded languages and multiplication by a constant

A set of integers is $S$-recognizable in an abstract numeration system $S$ if
the language made up of the representations of its elements is accepted by a
finite automaton. For abstract numeration systems built over bounded languages
with at least three letters, we show that multiplication by an integer
$\lambda\ge2$ does not preserve $S$-recognizability, meaning that there always
exists a $S$-recognizable set $X$ such that $\lambda X$ is not
$S$-recognizable. The main tool is a bijection between the representation of an
integer over a bounded language and its decomposition as a sum of binomial
coefficients with certain properties, the so-called combinatorial numeration
system.

Robotic hardware designs are becoming more complex as the variety and number

ever-smaller packages on-board robots. These advances in hardware, however, do
not automatically translate into better software for controlling complex
robots. Evolutionary techniques hold the potential to solve many difficult
problems in robotics which defy simple conventional approaches, but present
many challenges as well. Numerous disciplines including artificial life,
cognitive science and neural networks, rule-based systems, behavior-based

Virtual Sensor Based Fault Detection and Classification on a Plasma Etch Reactor
2007-06-04

Sofge,D. A.

The SEMATECH sponsored J-88-E project teaming Texas Instruments with
NeuroDyne (et al.) focused on Fault Detection and Classification (FDC) on a Lam
9600 aluminum plasma etch reactor, used in the process of semiconductor
fabrication. Fault classification was accomplished by implementing a series of
virtual sensor models which used data from real sensors (Lam Station sensors,
Optical Emission Spectroscopy, and RF Monitoring) to predict recipe setpoints
and wafer state characteristics. Fault detection and classification were
performed by comparing predicted recipe and wafer state values with expected
values. Models utilized include linear PLS, Polynomial PLS, and Neural Network
PLS. Prediction of recipe setpoints based upon sensor data provides a
capability for cross-checking that the machine is maintaining the desired
setpoints. Wafer state characteristics such as Line Width Reduction and
Remaining Oxide were estimated on-line using these same process sensors (Lam,
OES, RFM). Wafer-to-wafer measurement of these characteristics in a production
setting (where typically this information may be only sparsely available, if at
all, after batch processing runs with numerous wafers have been completed)
would provide important information to the operator that the process is or is
not producing wafers within acceptable bounds of product quality. Production
yield is increased, and correspondingly per unit cost is reduced, by providing
the operator with the opportunity to adjust the process or machine before
etching more wafers.

Sampling Colourings of the Triangular Lattice
2007-06-04
2010-10-25
Jalsenius,Markus

We show that the Glauber dynamics on proper 9-colourings of the triangular
lattice is rapidly mixing, which allows for efficient sampling. Consequently,
there is a fully polynomial randomised approximation scheme (FPRAS) for
counting proper 9-colourings of the triangular lattice. Proper colourings
correspond to configurations in the zero-temperature anti-ferromagnetic Potts
model. We show that the spin system consisting of proper 9-colourings of the
triangular lattice has strong spatial mixing. This implies that there is a
unique infinite-volume Gibbs distribution, which is an important property
studied in statistical physics. Our results build on previous work by Goldberg,
Martin and Paterson, who showed similar results for 10 colours on the
triangular lattice. Their work was preceded by Salas and Sokal's 11-colour
result. Both proofs rely on computational assistance, and so does our 9-colour
proof. We have used a randomised heuristic to guide us towards rigourous
results.

Relating two standard notions of secrecy
2007-06-04
2007-07-06
Cortier,Veronique
Rusinovitch,Michael
Zalinescu,Eugen

Two styles of definitions are usually considered to express that a security
protocol preserves the confidentiality of a data s. Reachability-based secrecy
means that s should never be disclosed while equivalence-based secrecy states
that two executions of a protocol with distinct instances for s should be
indistinguishable to an attacker. Although the second formulation ensures a
higher level of security and is closer to cryptographic notions of secrecy,
decidability results and automatic tools have mainly focused on the first
definition so far.
  This paper initiates a systematic investigation of the situations where
syntactic secrecy entails strong secrecy. We show that in the passive case,
reachability-based secrecy actually implies equivalence-based secrecy for
digital signatures, symmetric and asymmetric encryption provided that the
primitives are probabilistic. For active adversaries, we provide sufficient
(and rather tight) conditions on the protocol for this implication to hold.

A collaborative framework to exchange and share product information within a supply chain context
2007-06-04

Geryville,Hichem
Ouzrout,Yacine
Bouras,Abdelaziz
Sapidis,Nikolaos

The new requirement for "collaboration" between multidisciplinary
collaborators induces to exchange and share adequate information on the
product, processes throughout the products' lifecycle. Thus, effective capture
of information, and also its extraction, recording, exchange, sharing, and
reuse become increasingly critical. These lead companies to adopt new improved
methodologies in managing the exchange and sharing of information. The aim of
this paper is to describe a collaborative framework system to exchange and
share information, which is based on: (i) The Product Process Collaboration
Organization model (PPCO) which defines product and process information, and
the various collaboration methods for the organizations involved in the supply
chain. (ii) Viewpoint model describes relationships between each actor and the
comprehensive Product/Process model, defining each actor's "domain of interest"
within the evolving product definition. (iii) A layer which defines the
comprehensive organization and collaboration relationships between the actors
within the supply chain. (iv) Based on the above relationships, the last layer
proposes a typology of exchanged messages. A communication method, based on
XML, is developed that supports optimal exchange/sharing of information. To
illustrate the proposed framework system, an example is presented related to
collaborative design of a new piston for an automotive engine. The focus is on
user-viewpoint integration to ensure that the adequate information is retrieved
from the PPCO.

Interpolant-Based Transition Relation Approximation
2007-06-04

Jhala,Ranjit
McMillan,Kenneth L.

In predicate abstraction, exact image computation is problematic, requiring
in the worst case an exponential number of calls to a decision procedure. For
this reason, software model checkers typically use a weak approximation of the
image. This can result in a failure to prove a property, even given an adequate
set of predicates. We present an interpolant-based method for strengthening the
abstract transition relation in case of such failures. This approach guarantees
convergence given an adequate set of predicates, without requiring an exact
image computation. We show empirically that the method converges more rapidly
than an earlier method based on counterexample analysis.

Compressed Regression

Zhou,Shuheng
Lafferty,John
Wasserman,Larry

Recent research has studied the role of sparsity in high dimensional
regression and signal reconstruction, establishing theoretical limits for
recovering sparse models from sparse data. This line of work shows that
$\ell_1$-regularized least squares regression can accurately estimate a sparse
linear model from $n$ noisy examples in $p$ dimensions, even if $p$ is much
larger than $n$. In this paper we study a variant of this problem where the
original $n$ input variables are compressed by a random linear transformation
to $m \ll n$ examples in $p$ dimensions, and establish conditions under which a
sparse linear model can be successfully recovered from the compressed data. A
primary motivation for this compression procedure is to anonymize the data and
preserve privacy by revealing little information about the original data. We
characterize the number of random projections that are required for
$\ell_1$-regularized compressed regression to identify the nonzero coefficients
in the true model with probability approaching one, a property called
``sparsistence.'' In addition, we show that $\ell_1$-regularized compressed
regression asymptotically predicts as well as an oracle linear model, a
property called ``persistence.'' Finally, we characterize the privacy
properties of the compression procedure in information-theoretic terms,
establishing upper bounds on the mutual information between the compressed and
uncompressed data that decay to zero.

Efficient Batch Update of Unique Identifiers in a Distributed Hash Table for Resources in a Mobile Host
2007-06-05
2010-06-20
Chung,Yoo

Resources in a distributed system can be identified using identifiers based
on random numbers. When using a distributed hash table to resolve such
identifiers to network locations, the straightforward approach is to store the
network location directly in the hash table entry associated with an
identifier. When a mobile host contains a large number of resources, this
requires that all of the associated hash table entries must be updated when its
network address changes.
  We propose an alternative approach where we store a host identifier in the
entry associated with a resource identifier and the actual network address of
the host in a separate host entry. This can drastically reduce the time
required for updating the distributed hash table when a mobile host changes its
network address. We also investigate under which circumstances our approach
should or should not be used. We evaluate and confirm the usefulness of our
approach with experiments run on top of OpenDHT.

propose a new model for working set selection in sequential minimal
optimization (SMO) decomposition methods. In this model, it selects B as
working set without reselection. Some properties are given by simple proof, and
experiments demonstrate that the proposed method is in general faster than
existing methods.

Burnashev,Marat V.

A new approach for upper bounding the channel reliability function using the

Non-Parametric Field Estimation using Randomly Deployed, Noisy, Binary Sensors
2007-06-05
2007-12-13
Wang,Ye
Ishwar,Prakash

The reconstruction of a deterministic data field from binary-quantized noisy
observations of sensors which are randomly deployed over the field domain is
studied. The study focuses on the extremes of lack of deterministic control in
the sensor deployment, lack of knowledge of the noise distribution, and lack of
sensing precision and reliability. Such adverse conditions are motivated by
possible real-world scenarios where a large collection of low-cost, crudely
manufactured sensors are mass-deployed in an environment where little can be
assumed about the ambient noise. A simple estimator that reconstructs the
entire data field from these unreliable, binary-quantized, noisy observations
is proposed. Technical conditions for the almost sure and integrated mean
squared error (MSE) convergence of the estimate to the data field, as the
number of sensors tends to infinity, are derived and their implications are
discussed. For finite-dimensional, bounded-variation, and
Sobolev-differentiable function classes, specific integrated MSE decay rates
are derived. For the first and third function classes these rates are found to
be minimax order optimal with respect to infinite precision sensing and known
noise distribution.

Probabilistic Interval Temporal Logic and Duration Calculus with Infinite Intervals: Complete Proof Systems
2007-06-05
2007-07-19
Guelev,Dimitar P.

The paper presents probabilistic extensions of interval temporal logic (ITL)
and duration calculus (DC) with infinite intervals and complete Hilbert-style
proof systems for them. The completeness results are a strong completeness
theorem for the system of probabilistic ITL with respect to an abstract
semantics and a relative completeness theorem for the system of probabilistic
DC with respect to real-time semantics. The proposed systems subsume
probabilistic real-time DC as known from the literature. A correspondence
between the proposed systems and a system of probabilistic interval temporal
logic with finite intervals and expanding modalities is established too.

Universal Quantile Estimation with Feedback in the Communication-Constrained Setting
2007-06-05

Rajagopal,Ram
Wainwright,Martin J.

We consider the following problem of decentralized statistical inference:
given i.i.d. samples from an unknown distribution, estimate an arbitrary
quantile subject to limits on the number of bits exchanged. We analyze a
standard fusion-based architecture, in which each of $m$ sensors transmits a
single bit to the fusion center, which in turn is permitted to send some number
$k$ bits of feedback. Supposing that each of $\nodenum$ sensors receives $n$
observations, the optimal centralized protocol yields mean-squared error
decaying as $\order(1/[n m])$. We develop and analyze the performance of
various decentralized protocols in comparison to this centralized
gold-standard. First, we describe a decentralized protocol based on $k =
\log(\nodenum)$ bits of feedback that is strongly consistent, and achieves the
same asymptotic MSE as the centralized optimum. Second, we describe and analyze
a decentralized protocol based on only a single bit ($k=1$) of feedback. For
step sizes independent of $m$, it achieves an asymptotic MSE of order
$\order[1/(n \sqrt{m})]$, whereas for step sizes decaying as $1/\sqrt{m}$, it
achieves the same $\order(1/[n m])$ decay in MSE as the centralized optimum.
Our theoretical results are complemented by simulations, illustrating the
tradeoffs between these different protocols.

Position Coding

Aboufadel,Edward
Armstrong,Timothy
Smietana,Elizabeth

A position coding pattern is an array of symbols in which subarrays of a
certain fixed size appear at most once. So, each subarray uniquely identifies a
location in the larger array, which means there is a bijection of some sort
from this set of subarrays to a set of coordinates. The key to Fly Pentop
Computer paper and other examples of position codes is a method to read the
subarray and then convert it to coordinates. Position coding makes use of ideas
from discrete mathematics and number theory. In this paper, we will describe
the underlying mathematics of two position codes, one being the Anoto code that
is the basis of "Fly paper". Then, we will present two new codes, one which
uses binary wavelets as part of the bijection.

Inferring the Composition of a Trader Population in a Financial Market

We discuss a method for predicting financial movements and finding pockets of
predictability in the price-series, which is built around inferring the
heterogeneity of trading strategies in a multi-agent trader population. This
work explores extensions to our previous framework (arXiv:physics/0506134).
Here we allow for more intelligent agents possessing a richer strategy set, and
we no longer constrain the estimate for the heterogeneity of the agents to a
probability space. We also introduce a scheme which allows the incorporation of
models with a wide variety of agent types, and discuss a mechanism for the
removal of bias from relevant parameters.

Families of traveling impulses and fronts in some models with cross-diffusion
2007-06-06

Berezovskaya,Faina
Novozhilov,Artem
Karev,Georgy

An analysis of traveling wave solutions of partial differential equation
(PDE) systems with cross-diffusion is presented. The systems under study fall
in a general class of the classical Keller-Segel models to describe chemotaxis.
The analysis is conducted using the theory of the phase plane analysis of the
corresponding wave systems without a priory restrictions on the boundary
conditions of the initial PDE. Special attention is paid to families of
traveling wave solutions. Conditions for existence of front-impulse,
impulse-front, and front-front traveling wave solutions are formulated. In
particular, the simplest mathematical model is presented that has an
impulse-impulse solution; we also show that a non-isolated singular point in
the ordinary differential equation (ODE) wave system implies existence of
free-boundary fronts. The results can be used for construction and analysis of
different mathematical models describing systems with chemotaxis.

A straight-line drawing $\delta$ of a planar graph $G$ need not be plane, but
can be made so by moving some of the vertices. Let shift$(G,\delta)$ denote the
minimum number of vertices that need to be moved to turn $\delta$ into a plane
drawing of $G$. We show that shift$(G,\delta)$ is NP-hard to compute and to
approximate, and we give explicit bounds on shift$(G,\delta)$ when $G$ is a

Probabilistic Anonymity and Admissible Schedulers
2007-06-07

Garcia,Flavio D.
van Rossum,Peter
Sokolova,Ana

When studying safety properties of (formal) protocol models, it is customary
to view the scheduler as an adversary: an entity trying to falsify the safety
property. We show that in the context of security protocols, and in particular
of anonymizing protocols, this gives the adversary too much power; for
instance, the contents of encrypted messages and internal computations by the
parties should be considered invisible to the adversary.
  We restrict the class of schedulers to a class of admissible schedulers which
better model adversarial behaviour. These admissible schedulers base their
decision solely on the past behaviour of the system that is visible to the
adversary.
  Using this, we propose a definition of anonymity: for all admissible
schedulers the identity of the users and the observations of the adversary are
independent stochastic variables. We also develop a proof technique for typical
cases that can be used to proof anonymity: a system is anonymous if it is
possible to `exchange' the behaviour of two users without the adversary
`noticing'.

Improved Neural Modeling of Real-World Systems Using Genetic Algorithm Based Variable Selection
2007-06-07

Sofge,Donald A.
Elliott,David L.

Neural network models of real-world systems, such as industrial processes,
made from sensor data must often rely on incomplete data. System states may not
all be known, sensor data may be biased or noisy, and it is not often known
which sensor data may be useful for predictive modelling. Genetic algorithms
may be used to help to address this problem by determining the near optimal
subset of sensor variables most appropriate to produce good models. This paper
describes the use of genetic search to optimize variable selection to determine
inputs into the neural network model. We discuss genetic algorithm
implementation issues including data representation types and genetic operators
such as crossover and mutation. We present the use of this technique for neural
network modelling of a typical industrial application, a liquid fed ceramic
melter, and detail the results of the genetic search to optimize the neural
network model for this application.

low-level joint angle control employing force/position feedback constraints,

Small-worlds represent efficient communication networks that obey two

that removing links in a network can increase the overall clustering
coefficient. Reckful Roaming, as introduced in this paper, is a 2-localized
algorithm that takes advantage of this paradox in order to selectively remove
superfluous links, this way optimizing the clustering coefficient while still
retaining a sufficiently small characteristic path length.

WACA: A Hierarchical Weighted Clustering Algorithm optimized for Mobile Hybrid Networks
2007-06-07

Brust,Matthias R.
Andronache,Adrian
Rothkugel,Steffen

Clustering techniques create hierarchal network structures, called clusters,
on an otherwise flat network. In a dynamic environment-in terms of node
mobility as well as in terms of steadily changing device parameters-the
clusterhead election process has to be re-invoked according to a suitable
update policy. Cluster re-organization causes additional message exchanges and
computational complexity and it execution has to be optimized. Our
investigations focus on the problem of minimizing clusterhead re-elections by
considering stability criteria. These criteria are based on topological
characteristics as well as on device parameters. This paper presents a weighted
clustering algorithm optimized to avoid needless clusterhead re-elections for
stable clusters in mobile ad-hoc networks. The proposed localized algorithm
deals with mobility, but does not require geographical, speed or distances
information.

Sublinear Algorithms for Approximating String Compressibility
2007-06-07

Raskhodnikova,Sofya
Ron,Dana
Rubinfeld,Ronitt
Smith,Adam

We raise the question of approximating the compressibility of a string with
respect to a fixed compression scheme, in sublinear time. We study this
question in detail for two popular lossless compression schemes: run-length
encoding (RLE) and Lempel-Ziv (LZ), and present sublinear algorithms for
approximating compressibility with respect to both schemes. We also give
several lower bounds that show that our algorithms for both schemes cannot be
improved significantly.
  Our investigation of LZ yields results whose interest goes beyond the initial
questions we set out to study. In particular, we prove combinatorial structural
lemmas that relate the compressibility of a string with respect to Lempel-Ziv
to the number of distinct short substrings contained in it. In addition, we
show that approximating the compressibility with respect to LZ is related to
approximating the support size of a distribution.

On Anomalies in Annotation Systems
2007-06-07

Brust,Matthias R.
Rothkugel,Steffen

Today's computer-based annotation systems implement a wide range of
functionalities that often go beyond those available in traditional
paper-and-pencil annotations. Conceptually, annotation systems are based on
thoroughly investigated psycho-sociological and pedagogical learning theories.
They offer a huge diversity of annotation types that can be placed in textual
as well as in multimedia format. Additionally, annotations can be published or
shared with a group of interested parties via well-organized repositories.
Although highly sophisticated annotation systems exist both conceptually as
well as technologically, we still observe that their acceptance is somewhat
limited. In this paper, we argue that nowadays annotation systems suffer from
several fundamental problems that are inherent in the traditional
paper-and-pencil annotation paradigm. As a solution, we propose to shift the
annotation paradigm for the implementation of annotation system.

Mobile multi-hop ad hoc networks allow establishing local groups of
communicating devices in a self-organizing way. However, in a global setting
such networks fail to work properly due to network partitioning. Providing that
devices are capable of communicating both locally-e.g. using Wi-Fi or
Bluetooth-and additionally also with arbitrary remote devices-e.g. using
GSM/UMTS links-the objective is to find efficient ways of inter-linking
multiple network partitions. Tackling this problem of topology control, we
focus on the class of small-world networks that obey two distinguishing
characteristics: they have a strong local clustering while still retaining a
small average distance between two nodes. This paper reports on results gained
investigating the question if small-world properties are indicative for an
efficient link management in multiple multi-hop ad hoc network partitions.

Asynchronous games: innocence without alternation
2007-06-08

Melliès,Paul-André
Mimram,Samuel

The notion of innocent strategy was introduced by Hyland and Ong in order to
capture the interactive behaviour of lambda-terms and PCF programs. An innocent
strategy is defined as an alternating strategy with partial memory, in which
the strategy plays according to its view. Extending the definition to
non-alternating strategies is problematic, because the traditional definition
of views is based on the hypothesis that Opponent and Proponent alternate
during the interaction. Here, we take advantage of the diagrammatic
reformulation of alternating innocence in asynchronous games, in order to
provide a tentative definition of innocence in non-alternating games. The task
is interesting, and far from easy. It requires the combination of true
concurrency and game semantics in a clean and organic way, clarifying the
relationship between asynchronous games and concurrent games in the sense of
Abramsky and Melli\`es. It also requires an interactive reformulation of the
usual acyclicity criterion of linear logic, as well as a directed variant, as a
scheduling criterion.

Redesigning Computer-based Learning Environments: Evaluation as Communication
2007-06-08

Brust,Matthias R.
Adriano,Christian M.
Ricarte,Ivan M. L.

In the field of evaluation research, computer scientists live constantly upon
dilemmas and conflicting theories. As evaluation is differently perceived and
modeled among educational areas, it is not difficult to become trapped in
dilemmas, which reflects an epistemological weakness. Additionally, designing
and developing a computer-based learning scenario is not an easy task.
Advancing further, with end-users probing the system in realistic settings, is
even harder. Computer science research in evaluation faces an immense
challenge, having to cope with contributions from several conflicting and
controversial research fields. We believe that deep changes must be made in our
field if we are to advance beyond the CBT (computer-based training) learning
model and to build an adequate epistemology for this challenge. The first task
is to relocate our field by building upon recent results from philosophy,
psychology, social sciences, and engineering. In this article we locate
evaluation in respect to communication studies. Evaluation presupposes a
definition of goals to be reached, and we suggest that it is, by many means, a
silent communication between teacher and student, peers, and institutional
entities. If we accept that evaluation can be viewed as set of invisible rules
known by nobody, but somehow understood by everybody, we should add
anthropological inquiries to our research toolkit. The paper is organized
around some elements of the social communication and how they convey new
insights to evaluation research for computer and related scientists. We found
some technical limitations and offer discussions on how we relate to technology
at same time we establish expectancies and perceive others work.

A Communication Model for Adaptive Service Provisioning in Hybrid Wireless Networks
2007-06-08

Brust,Matthias R.
Rothkugel,Steffen

Mobile entities with wireless links are able to form a mobile ad-hoc network.
Such an infrastructureless network does not have to be administrated. However,
self-organizing principles have to be applied to deal with upcoming problems,
e.g. information dissemination. These kinds of problems are not easy to tackle,
requiring complex algorithms. Moreover, the usefulness of pure ad-hoc networks
is arguably limited. Hence, enthusiasm for mobile ad-hoc networks, which could
eliminate the need for any fixed infrastructure, has been damped. The goal is
to overcome the limitations of pure ad-hoc networks by augmenting them with
instant Internet access, e.g. via integration of UMTS respectively GSM links.
However, this raises multiple questions at the technical as well as the
organizational level. Motivated by characteristics of small-world networks that
describe an efficient network even without central or organized design, this
paper proposes to combine mobile ad-hoc networks and infrastructured networks
to form hybrid wireless networks. One main objective is to investigate how this
approach can reduce the costs of a permanent backbone link and providing in the
same way the benefits of useful information from Internet connectivity or
service providers. For the purpose of bridging between the different types of
networks, an adequate middleware service is the focus of our investigation.
This paper shows our first steps forward to this middleware by introducing the
Injection Communication paradigm as principal concept.

Multimedia Content Distribution in Hybrid Wireless Networks using Weighted Clustering
2007-06-08

Andronache,Adrian
Brust,Matthias R.
Rothkugel,Steffen

Fixed infrastructured networks naturally support centralized approaches for
group management and information provisioning. Contrary to infrastructured
networks, in multi-hop ad-hoc networks each node acts as a router as well as
sender and receiver. Some applications, however, requires hierarchical
arrangements that-for practical reasons-has to be done locally and
self-organized. An additional challenge is to deal with mobility that causes
permanent network partitioning and re-organizations. Technically, these
problems can be tackled by providing additional uplinks to a backbone network,
which can be used to access resources in the Internet as well as to inter-link
multiple ad-hoc network partitions, creating a hybrid wireless network. In this
paper, we present a prototypically implemented hybrid wireless network system
optimized for multimedia content distribution. To efficiently manage the ad-hoc
communicating devices a weighted clustering algorithm is introduced. The
proposed localized algorithm deals with mobility, but does not require
geographical information or distances.

Localized Support for Injection Point Election in Hybrid Networks
2007-06-08

Brust,Matthias R.
Rothkugel,Steffen

Ad-hoc networks, a promising trend in wireless technology, fail to work
properly in a global setting. In most cases, self-organization and cost-free
local communication cannot compensate the need for being connected, gathering
urgent information just-in-time. Equipping mobile devices additionally with GSM
or UMTS adapters in order to communicate with arbitrary remote devices or even
a fixed network infrastructure provides an opportunity. Devices that operate as
intermediate nodes between the ad-hoc network and a reliable backbone network
are potential injection points. They allow disseminating received information
within the local neighborhood. The effectiveness of different devices to serve
as injection point differs substantially. For practical reasons the
determination of injection points should be done locally, within the ad-hoc
network partitions. We analyze different localized algorithms using at most
2-hop neighboring information. Results show that devices selected this way
spread information more efficiently through the ad-hoc network. Our results can
also be applied in order to support the election process for clusterheads in
the field of clustering mechanisms.

A taxonomic Approach to Topology Control in Ad-hoc and Wireless Networks

Topology Control (TC) aims at tuning the topology of highly dynamic networks
to provide better control over network resources and to increase the efficiency
of communication. Recently, many TC protocols have been proposed. The protocols
are designed for preserving connectivity, minimizing energy consumption,
maximizing the overall network coverage or network capacity. Each TC protocol
makes different assumptions about the network topology, environment detection
resources, and control capacities. This circumstance makes it extremely
difficult to comprehend the role and purpose of each protocol. To tackle this
situation, a taxonomy for TC protocols is presented throughout this paper.
Additionally, some TC protocols are classified based upon this taxonomy.

The multiple viewpoints as approach to information retrieval within collaborative development context

Nowadays, to achieve competitive advantage, the industrial companies are
considering that success is sustained to great product development. That is to
manage the product throughout its entire lifecycle. Achieving this goal
requires a tight collaboration between actors from a wide variety of domains,
using different software tools producing various product data types and
formats. The actors' collaboration is mainly based on the exchange /share
product information. The representation of the actors' viewpoints is the
underlying requirement of the collaborative product development. The multiple
viewpoints approach was designed to provide an organizational framework
following the actors' perspectives in the collaboration, and their
relationships. The approach acknowledges the inevitability of multiple
integration of product information as different views, promotes gathering of
actors' interest, and encourages retrieved adequate information while providing
support for integration through PLM and/or SCM collaboration. In this paper, a
multiple viewpoints representation is proposed. The product, process,
organization information models are discussed. A series of issues referring to
the viewpoints representation are discussed in detail. Based on XML standard,
taking electrical connector as an example, an application case of part of

the transmitted energy per symbol via its R-transform. We find that vector
precoding performs much better for complex than for real alphabets. As a
byproduct, we find a nonlinear precoding method with polynomial complexity that
outperforms NP-hard Tomlinson-Harashima precoding for binary modulation on
complex channels if the number of transmit antennas is slightly larger than
twice the number of receive antennas.

focus). The approach acknowledges the inevitability of multiple interpretation
of product information as different views, promotes gathering of actors'

cooperative learning system that is designed to act in hybrid wireless
networks. As a cooperative environment, CARLA aims at disseminating teaching
material, notes, and even components of itself through both fixed and mobile
networks to interested nodes. Due to the mobility of nodes, CARLA deals with

Temporal Reasoning without Transitive Tables
2007-06-09

Schwer,Sylviane R.

Representing and reasoning about qualitative temporal information is an
essential part of many artificial intelligence tasks. Lots of models have been
proposed in the litterature for representing such temporal information. All
derive from a point-based or an interval-based framework. One fundamental
reasoning task that arises in applications of these frameworks is given by the
following scheme: given possibly indefinite and incomplete knowledge of the
binary relationships between some temporal objects, find the consistent
scenarii between all these objects. All these models require transitive tables
-- or similarly inference rules-- for solving such tasks. We have defined an
alternative model, S-languages - to represent qualitative temporal information,
based on the only two relations of \emph{precedence} and \emph{simultaneity}.
In this paper, we show how this model enables to avoid transitive tables or
inference rules to handle this kind of problem.

Opportunistic Network Coding for Video Streaming over Wireless

Seferoglu,Hulya
Markopoulou,Athina

In this paper, we study video streaming over wireless networks with network
coding capabilities. We build upon recent work, which demonstrated that network
coding can increase throughput over a broadcast medium, by mixing packets from
different flows into a single packet, thus increasing the information content
per transmission. Our key insight is that, when the transmitted flows are video
streams, network codes should be selected so as to maximize not only the
network throughput but also the video quality. We propose video-aware
opportunistic network coding schemes that take into account both (i) the
decodability of network codes by several receivers and (ii) the importance and
deadlines of video packets. Simulation results show that our schemes
significantly improve both video quality and throughput.

Duality and Stability Regions of Multi-rate Broadcast and Multiple Access Networks

We characterize stability regions of two-user fading Gaussian multiple access
(MAC) and broadcast (BC) networks with centralized scheduling. The data to be
transmitted to the users is encoded into codewords of fixed length. The rates
of the codewords used are restricted to a fixed set of finite cardinality. With
successive decoding and interference cancellation at the receivers, we find the
set of arrival rates that can be stabilized over the MAC and BC networks. In
MAC and BC networks with average power constraints, we observe that the duality
property that relates the MAC and BC information theoretic capacity regions
extend to their stability regions as well. In MAC and BC networks with peak
power constraints, the union of stability regions of dual MAC networks is found
to be strictly contained in the BC stability region.

Analyzing Design Process and Experiments on the AnITA Generic Tutoring System
2007-06-11
2018-06-12
Brust,Matthias R.
Rothkugel,Steffen

In the field of tutoring systems, investigations have shown that there are
many tutoring systems specific to a specific domain that, because of their
static architecture, cannot be adapted to other domains. As consequence, often
neither methods nor knowledge can be reused. In addition, the knowledge
engineer must have programming skills in order to enhance and evaluate the
system. One particular challenge is to tackle these problems with the
development of a generic tutoring system. AnITA, as a stand-alone application,
has been developed and implemented particularly for this purpose. However, in
the testing phase, we discovered that this architecture did not fully match the
user's intuitive understanding of the use of a learning tool. Therefore, AnITA
has been redesigned to exclusively work as a client/server application and
renamed to AnITA2. This paper discusses the evolvements made on the AnITA
tutoring system, the goal of which is to use generic principles for system
re-use in any domain. Two experiments were conducted, and the results are
presented in this paper.

Evolutionary Mesh Numbering: Preliminary Results
2007-06-11

Sourd,Francis
Schoenauer,Marc

Mesh numbering is a critical issue in Finite Element Methods, as the
computational cost of one analysis is highly dependent on the order of the
nodes of the mesh. This paper presents some preliminary investigations on the
problem of mesh numbering using Evolutionary Algorithms. Three conclusions can
be drawn from these experiments. First, the results of the up-to-date method
used in all FEM softwares (Gibb's method) can be consistently improved; second,
none of the crossover operators tried so far (either general or problem
specific) proved useful; third, though the general tendency in Evolutionary
Computation seems to be the hybridization with other methods (deterministic or
heuristic), none of the presented attempt did encounter any success yet. The
good news, however, is that this algorithm allows an improvement over the
standard heuristic method between 12% and 20% for both the 1545 and 5453-nodes
meshes used as test-bed. Finally, some strange interaction between the
selection scheme and the use of problem specific mutation operator was
observed, which appeals for further investigation.

A Generic Model of Contracts for Embedded Systems
2007-06-11
2007-06-13
Benveniste,Albert
Caillaud,Benoit
Passerone,Roberto

We present the mathematical foundations of the contract-based model developed
in the framework of the SPEEDS project. SPEEDS aims at developing methods and
tools to support "speculative design", a design methodology in which
distributed designers develop different aspects of the overall system, in a
concurrent but controlled way. Our generic mathematical model of contract
supports this style of development. This is achieved by focusing on behaviors,
by supporting the notion of "rich component" where diverse (functional and
non-functional) aspects of the system can be considered and combined, by
representing rich components via their set of associated contracts, and by
formalizing the whole process of component composition.

VPSPACE and a transfer theorem over the complex field
2007-06-11

Koiran,Pascal
Perifel,Sylvain

We extend the transfer theorem of [KP2007] to the complex field. That is, we
investigate the links between the class VPSPACE of families of polynomials and
the Blum-Shub-Smale model of computation over C. Roughly speaking, a family of
polynomials is in VPSPACE if its coefficients can be computed in polynomial
space. Our main result is that if (uniform, constant-free) VPSPACE families can
be evaluated efficiently then the class PAR of decision problems that can be
solved in parallel polynomial time over the complex field collapses to P. As a
result, one must first be able to show that there are VPSPACE families which
are hard to evaluate in order to separate P from NP over C, or even from PAR.

Optimal Choice of Threshold in Two Level Processor Sharing
2007-06-12
2007-06-13
Avrachenkov,Konstantin
Brown,Patrick
Osipova,Natalia

We analyze the Two Level Processor Sharing (TLPS) scheduling discipline with
the hyper-exponential job size distribution and with the Poisson arrival
process. TLPS is a convenient model to study the benefit of the file size based
differentiation in TCP/IP networks. In the case of the hyper-exponential job
size distribution with two phases, we find a closed form analytic expression
for the expected sojourn time and an approximation for the optimal value of the
threshold that minimizes the expected sojourn time. In the case of the
hyper-exponential job size distribution with more than two phases, we derive a
tight upper bound for the expected sojourn time conditioned on the job size. We
show that when the variance of the job size distribution increases, the gain in
system performance increases and the sensitivity to the choice of the threshold
near its optimal value decreases.

Detection of Gauss-Markov Random Fields with Nearest-Neighbor Dependency
2007-06-11
2010-06-08
Anandkumar,Animashree
Tong,Lang
Swami,Ananthram

The problem of hypothesis testing against independence for a Gauss-Markov
random field (GMRF) is analyzed. Assuming an acyclic dependency graph, an
expression for the log-likelihood ratio of detection is derived. Assuming
random placement of nodes over a large region according to the Poisson or
uniform distribution and nearest-neighbor dependency graph, the error exponent
of the Neyman-Pearson detector is derived using large-deviations theory. The
error exponent is expressed as a dependency-graph functional and the limit is
evaluated through a special law of large numbers for stabilizing graph
functionals. The exponent is analyzed for different values of the variance
ratio and correlation. It is found that a more correlated GMRF has a higher
exponent at low values of the variance ratio whereas the situation is reversed
at high values of the variance ratio.

Non-Cooperative Scheduling of Multiple Bag-of-Task Applications
2007-06-12

Legrand,Arnaud
Touati,Corinne

Multiple applications that execute concurrently on heterogeneous platforms
compete for CPU and network resources. In this paper we analyze the behavior of
$K$ non-cooperative schedulers using the optimal strategy that maximize their
efficiency while fairness is ensured at a system level ignoring applications
characteristics. We limit our study to simple single-level master-worker
platforms and to the case where each scheduler is in charge of a single
application consisting of a large number of independent tasks. The tasks of a
given application all have the same computation and communication requirements,
but these requirements can vary from one application to another. In this
context, we assume that each scheduler aims at maximizing its throughput. We
give closed-form formula of the equilibrium reached by such a system and study
its performance. We characterize the situations where this Nash equilibrium is
optimal (in the Pareto sense) and show that even though no catastrophic
situation (Braess-like paradox) can occur, such an equilibrium can be
arbitrarily bad for any classical performance measure.

by means of adding a new edge to an $l$-component in a randomly growing graph
with $n$ vertices, tends to 1 as $l,n$ tends to $\infty$ but with $l =
o(n^{1/4})$. We also show, under the same conditions on $l$ and $n$, that the

A Methodology for Efficient Space-Time Adapter Design Space Exploration: A Case Study of an Ultra Wide Band Interleaver
2007-06-12

Chavet,Cyrille
Coussy,Philippe
Urard,Pascal
Martin,Eric

This paper presents a solution to efficiently explore the design space of
communication adapters. In most digital signal processing (DSP) applications,
the overall architecture of the system is significantly affected by
communication architecture, so the designers need specifically optimized
adapters. By explicitly modeling these communications within an effective
graph-theoretic model and analysis framework, we automatically generate an
optimized architecture, named Space-Time AdapteR (STAR). Our design flow inputs
a C description of Input/Output data scheduling, and user requirements
(throughput, latency, parallelism...), and formalizes communication constraints
through a Resource Constraints Graph (RCG). The RCG properties enable an
efficient architecture space exploration in order to synthesize a STAR
component. The proposed approach has been tested to design an industrial data
mixing block example: an Ultra-Wideband interleaver.

Information Criteria and Arithmetic Codings : An Illustration on Raw Images
2007-06-12

Coq,Guilhem
Alata,Olivier
Arnaudon,Marc
Olivier,Christian

In this paper we give a short theoretical description of the general
predictive adaptive arithmetic coding technique. The links between this
technique and the works of J. Rissanen in the 80's, in particular the BIC
information criterion used in parametrical model selection problems, are
established. We also design lossless and lossy coding techniques of images. The
lossless technique uses a mix between fixed-length coding and arithmetic coding
and provides better compression results than those separate methods. That
technique is also seen to have an interesting application in the domain of
statistics since it gives a data-driven procedure for the non-parametrical
histogram selection problem. The lossy technique uses only predictive adaptive
arithmetic codes and shows how a good choice of the order of prediction might
lead to better results in terms of compression. We illustrate those coding
techniques on a raw grayscale image.

Modeling and analysis using hybrid Petri nets

This paper is devoted to the use of hybrid Petri nets (PNs) for modeling and
control of hybrid dynamic systems (HDS). Modeling, analysis and control of HDS
attract ever more of researchers' attention and several works have been devoted
to these topics. We consider in this paper the extensions of the PN formalism
(initially conceived for modeling and analysis of discrete event systems) in
the direction of hybrid modeling. We present, first, the continuous PN models.
These models are obtained from discrete PNs by the fluidification of the
markings. They constitute the first steps in the extension of PNs toward hybrid
modeling. Then, we present two hybrid PN models, which differ in the class of
HDS they can deal with. The first one is used for deterministic HDS modeling,
whereas the second one can deal with HDS with nondeterministic behavior.

On the Performance Evaluation of Encounter-based Worm Interactions Based on Node Characteristics
2007-06-13

Tanachaiwiwat,Sapon
Helmy,Ahmed

An encounter-based network is a frequently disconnected wireless ad-hoc
network requiring nearby neighbors to store and forward data utilizing mobility
and encounters over time. Using traditional approaches such as gateways or
firewalls for deterring worm propagation in encounter-based networks is
inappropriate. Because this type of network is highly dynamic and has no
specific boundary, a distributed counter-worm mechanism is needed. We propose
models for the worm interaction approach that relies upon automated beneficial
worm generation to alleviate problems of worm propagation in such networks. We
study and analyze the impact of key mobile node characteristics including node
cooperation, immunization, on-off behavior on the worm propagations and
interactions. We validate our proposed model using extensive simulations. We
also find that, in addition to immunization, cooperation can reduce the level
of worm infection. Furthermore, on-off behavior linearly impacts only timing
aspect but not the overall infection. Using realistic mobile network
measurements, we find that encounters are non-uniform, the trends are
consistent with the model but the magnitudes are drastically different.
Immunization seems to be the most effective in such scenarios. These findings
provide insight that we hope would aid to develop counter-worm protocols in
future encounter-based networks.

Power Allocation for Discrete-Input Delay-Limited Fading Channels
2007-06-13

Nguyen,Khoa D.
Fabregas,Albert Guillen i
Rasmussen,Lars K.

We consider power allocation algorithms for fixed-rate transmission over
Nakagami-m non-ergodic block-fading channels with perfect transmitter and
receiver channel state information and discrete input signal constellations,
under both short- and long-term power constraints. Optimal power allocation
schemes are shown to be direct applications of previous results in the
literature. We show that the SNR exponent of the optimal short-term scheme is
given by m times the Singleton bound. We also illustrate the significant gains
available by employing long-term power constraints. In particular, we analyze
the optimal long-term solution, showing that zero outage can be achieved
provided that the corresponding short-term SNR exponent with the same system
parameters is strictly greater than one. Conversely, if the short-term SNR
exponent is smaller than one, we show that zero outage cannot be achieved. In
this case, we derive the corresponding long-term SNR exponent as a function of
the Singleton bound. Due to the nature of the expressions involved, the
complexity of optimal schemes may be prohibitive for system implementation. We
therefore propose simple sub-optimal power allocation schemes whose outage
probability performance is very close to the minimum outage probability
obtained by optimal schemes. We also show the applicability of these techniques
to practical systems employing orthogonal frequency division multiplexing.

that can be used to solve it. His paper introduces the terminology "imaginary

Building Portable Thread Schedulers for Hierarchical Multiprocessors: the BubbleSched Framework
2007-06-14

Thibault,Samuel
Namyst,Raymond
Wacrenier,Pierre-André

Exploiting full computational power of current more and more hierarchical
multiprocessor machines requires a very careful distribution of threads and
data among the underlying non-uniform architecture. Unfortunately, most
operating systems only provide a poor scheduling API that does not allow
applications to transmit valuable scheduling hints to the system. In a previous
paper, we showed that using a bubble-based thread scheduler can significantly
improve applications' performance in a portable way. However, since
multithreaded applications have various scheduling requirements, there is no
universal scheduler that could meet all these needs. In this paper, we present
a framework that allows scheduling experts to implement and experiment with
customized thread schedulers. It provides a powerful API for dynamically
distributing bubbles among the machine in a high-level, portable, and efficient
way. Several examples show how experts can then develop, debug and tune their
own portable bubble schedulers.

Exploiting the full computational power of always deeper hierarchical

data among the underlying non-uniform architecture. The emergence of multi-core
chips and NUMA machines makes it important to minimize the number of remote
memory accesses, to favor cache affinities, and to guarantee fast completion of
synchronization steps. By using the BubbleSched platform as a threading backend
for the GOMP OpenMP compiler, we are able to easily transpose affinities of
thread teams into scheduling hints using abstractions called bubbles. We then
propose a scheduling strategy suited to nested OpenMP parallelism. The
resulting preliminary performance evaluations show an important improvement of
the speedup on a typical NAS OpenMP benchmark application.

A Finite Semantics of Simply-Typed Lambda Terms for Infinite Runs of<br> Automata
2007-06-14
2007-11-01
Aehlig,Klaus

Model checking properties are often described by means of finite automata.
Any particular such automaton divides the set of infinite trees into finitely
many classes, according to which state has an infinite run. Building the full
type hierarchy upon this interpretation of the base type gives a finite
semantics for simply-typed lambda-trees.
  A calculus based on this semantics is proven sound and complete. In
particular, for regular infinite lambda-trees it is decidable whether a given
automaton has a run or not. As regular lambda-trees are precisely recursion
schemes, this decidability result holds for arbitrary recursion schemes of
arbitrary level, without any syntactical restriction.

Efficient Multidimensional Data Redistribution for Resizable Parallel Computations
2007-06-14

Sudarsan,Rajesh
Ribbens,Calvin J.

Traditional parallel schedulers running on cluster supercomputers support
only static scheduling, where the number of processors allocated to an
application remains fixed throughout the execution of the job. This results in
under-utilization of idle system resources thereby decreasing overall system
throughput. In our research, we have developed a prototype framework called
ReSHAPE, which supports dynamic resizing of parallel MPI applications executing
on distributed memory platforms. The resizing library in ReSHAPE includes
support for releasing and acquiring processors and efficiently redistributing
application state to a new set of processors. In this paper, we derive an
algorithm for redistributing two-dimensional block-cyclic arrays from $P$ to
$Q$ processors, organized as 2-D processor grids. The algorithm ensures a
contention-free communication schedule for data redistribution if $P_r \leq
Q_r$ and $P_c \leq Q_c$. In other cases, the algorithm implements circular row
and column shifts on the communication schedule to minimize node contention.

Dualheap Selection Algorithm: Efficient, Inherently Parallel and Somewhat Mysterious
2007-06-14

Sepesi,Greg

An inherently parallel algorithm is proposed that efficiently performs
selection: finding the K-th largest member of a set of N members. Selection is
a common component of many more complex algorithms and therefore is a widely
studied problem.
  Not much is new in the proposed dualheap selection algorithm: the heap data
structure is from J.W.J.Williams, the bottom-up heap construction is from R.W.
Floyd, and the concept of a two heap data structure is from J.W.J. Williams and
D.E. Knuth. The algorithm's novelty is limited to a few relatively minor
implementation twists: 1) the two heaps are oriented with their roots at the
partition values rather than at the minimum and maximum values, 2)the coding of
one of the heaps (the heap of smaller values) employs negative indexing, and 3)
the exchange phase of the algorithm is similar to a bottom-up heap
construction, but navigates the heap with a post-order tree traversal.
  When run on a single processor, the dualheap selection algorithm's
performance is competitive with quickselect with median estimation, a common
variant of C.A.R. Hoare's quicksort algorithm. When run on parallel processors,
the dualheap selection algorithm is superior due to its subtasks that are
easily partitioned and innately balanced.

Resource control of object-oriented programs

A sup-interpretation is a tool which provides an upper bound on the size of a

their interest to deal with the complexity of first order functional programs.
For instance, they allow to characterize all the functions bitwise computable
in Alogtime. This paper is an attempt to adapt the framework of
sup-interpretations to a fragment of oriented-object programs, including
distinct encodings of numbers through the use of constructor symbols, loop and
while constructs and non recursive methods with side effects. We give a
criterion, called brotherly criterion, which ensures that each brotherly
program computes objects whose size is polynomially bounded by the inputs

Space-time coding techniques with bit-interleaved coded modulations for MIMO block-fading channels
2007-06-15

Gresset,Nicolas
Brunel,Loic
Boutros,Joseph

The space-time bit-interleaved coded modulation (ST-BICM) is an efficient
technique to obtain high diversity and coding gain on a block-fading MIMO
channel. Its maximum-likelihood (ML) performance is computed under ideal
interleaving conditions, which enables a global optimization taking into
account channel coding. Thanks to a diversity upperbound derived from the
Singleton bound, an appropriate choice of the time dimension of the space-time
coding is possible, which maximizes diversity while minimizing complexity.
Based on the analysis, an optimized interleaver and a set of linear precoders,
called dispersive nucleo algebraic (DNA) precoders are proposed. The proposed
precoders have good performance with respect to the state of the art and exist
for any number of transmit antennas and any time dimension. With turbo codes,
they exhibit a frame error rate which does not increase with frame length.

Interference and Outage in Clustered Wireless Ad Hoc Networks
2007-06-16

Ganti,RadhaKrishna
Haenggi,Martin

In the analysis of large random wireless networks, the underlying node
distribution is almost ubiquitously assumed to be the homogeneous Poisson point
process. In this paper, the node locations are assumed to form a Poisson
clustered process on the plane. We derive the distributional properties of the
interference and provide upper and lower bounds for its CCDF. We consider the
probability of successful transmission in an interference limited channel when
fading is modeled as Rayleigh. We provide a numerically integrable expression
for the outage probability and closed-form upper and lower bounds.We show that
when the transmitter-receiver distance is large, the success probability is
greater than that of a Poisson arrangement. These results characterize the
performance of the system under geographical or MAC-induced clustering. We
obtain the maximum intensity of transmitting nodes for a given outage
constraint, i.e., the transmission capacity (of this spatial arrangement) and
show that it is equal to that of a Poisson arrangement of nodes. For the
analysis, techniques from stochastic geometry are used, in particular the
probability generating functional of Poisson cluster processes, the Palm
characterization of Poisson cluster processes and the Campbell-Mecke theorem.

changed under asynchronous updates. Still, the few mathematical analyses of
asynchronism focus on one-dimensional probabilistic cellular automata, either
on single examples or on specific classes. As for other classic dynamical
systems in physics, extending known methods from one- to two-dimensional
systems is a long lasting challenging problem.
  In this paper, we address the problem of analysing an apparently simple 2D
asynchronous cellular automaton: 2D Minority where each cell, when fired,
updates to the minority state of its neighborhood. Our experiments reveal that
in spite of its simplicity, the minority rule exhibits a quite complex response
to asynchronism. By focusing on the fully asynchronous regime, we are however
able to describe completely the asymptotic behavior of this dynamics as long as
the initial configuration satisfies some natural constraints. Besides these
technical results, we have strong reasons to believe that our techniques
relying on defining an energy function from the transition table of the
automaton may be extended to the wider class of threshold automata.

Analysis of Inter-Domain Traffic Correlations: Random Matrix Theory Approach
2007-06-17

Rojkova,Viktoria
Kantardzic,Mehmed

The traffic behavior of University of Louisville network with the
interconnected backbone routers and the number of Virtual Local Area Network
(VLAN) subnets is investigated using the Random Matrix Theory (RMT) approach.
We employ the system of equal interval time series of traffic counts at all
router to router and router to subnet connections as a representation of the
inter-VLAN traffic. The cross-correlation matrix C of the traffic rate changes
between different traffic time series is calculated and tested against
null-hypothesis of random interactions.
  The majority of the eigenvalues \lambda_{i} of matrix C fall within the
bounds predicted by the RMT for the eigenvalues of random correlation matrices.
The distribution of eigenvalues and eigenvectors outside of the RMT bounds
displays prominent and systematic deviations from the RMT predictions.
Moreover, these deviations are stable in time.
  The method we use provides a unique possibility to accomplish three
concurrent tasks of traffic analysis. The method verifies the uncongested state
of the network, by establishing the profile of random interactions. It
recognizes the system-specific large-scale interactions, by establishing the
profile of stable in time non-random interactions. Finally, by looking into the
eigenstatistics we are able to detect and allocate anomalies of network traffic
interactions.

more examples (like call-by-value evaluation) illustrating the generality of
the underlying computing device. Precise correspondences between various
formulations of the evaluation mechanism of abstract Boehm trees are

Decisive Markov Chains
2007-06-18
2007-11-08
Abdulla,Parosh Aziz
Henda,Noomene Ben
Mayr,Richard

We consider qualitative and quantitative verification problems for
infinite-state Markov chains. We call a Markov chain decisive w.r.t. a given
set of target states F if it almost certainly eventually reaches either F or a
state from which F can no longer be reached. While all finite Markov chains are
trivially decisive (for every set F), this also holds for many classes of
infinite Markov chains. Infinite Markov chains which contain a finite attractor
are decisive w.r.t. every set F. In particular, this holds for probabilistic
lossy channel systems (PLCS). Furthermore, all globally coarse Markov chains
are decisive. This class includes probabilistic vector addition systems (PVASS)
and probabilistic noisy Turing machines (PNTM). We consider both safety and
liveness problems for decisive Markov chains, i.e., the probabilities that a
given set of states F is eventually reached or reached infinitely often,
respectively. 1. We express the qualitative problems in abstract terms for
decisive Markov chains, and show an almost complete picture of its decidability
for PLCS, PVASS and PNTM. 2. We also show that the path enumeration algorithm
of Iyer and Narasimha terminates for decisive Markov chains and can thus be
used to solve the approximate quantitative safety problem. A modified variant
of this algorithm solves the approximate quantitative liveness problem. 3.
Finally, we show that the exact probability of (repeatedly) reaching F cannot
be effectively expressed (in a uniform way) in Tarski-algebra for either PLCS,
PVASS or (P)NTM.

Randomness Extraction via Delta-Biased Masking in the Presence of a Quantum Attacker
2007-06-18
2007-12-13
Fehr,Serge
Schaffner,Christian

Randomness extraction is of fundamental importance for information-theoretic
cryptography. It allows to transform a raw key about which an attacker has some
limited knowledge into a fully secure random key, on which the attacker has
essentially no information. Up to date, only very few randomness-extraction
techniques are known to work against an attacker holding quantum information on
the raw key. This is very much in contrast to the classical (non-quantum)
setting, which is much better understood and for which a vast amount of
different techniques are known and proven to work.
  We prove a new randomness-extraction technique, which is known to work in the
classical setting, to be secure against a quantum attacker as well. Randomness
extraction is done by XOR'ing a so-called delta-biased mask to the raw key. Our
result allows to extend the classical applications of this extractor to the
quantum setting. We discuss the following two applications. We show how to
encrypt a long message with a short key, information-theoretically secure
against a quantum attacker, provided that the attacker has enough quantum
uncertainty on the message. This generalizes the concept of entropically-secure
encryption to the case of a quantum attacker. As second application, we show
how to do error-correction without leaking partial information to a quantum
attacker. Such a technique is useful in settings where the raw key may contain
errors, since standard error-correction techniques may provide the attacker
with information on, say, a secret key that was used to obtain the raw key.

Algorithms for Omega-Regular Games with Imperfect Information

Chatterjee,Krishnendu
Doyen,Laurent
Henzinger,Thomas A.
Raskin,<br> Jean-Francois

We study observation-based strategies for two-player turn-based games on
graphs with omega-regular objectives. An observation-based strategy relies on
imperfect information about the history of a play, namely, on the past sequence
of observations. Such games occur in the synthesis of a controller that does
not see the private state of the plant. Our main results are twofold. First, we
give a fixed-point algorithm for computing the set of states from which a
player can win with a deterministic observation-based strategy for any
omega-regular objective. The fixed point is computed in the lattice of
antichains of state sets. This algorithm has the advantages of being directed
by the objective and of avoiding an explicit subset construction on the game
graph. Second, we give an algorithm for computing the set of states from which
a player can win with probability 1 with a randomized observation-based
strategy for a Buechi objective. This set is of interest because in the absence
of perfect information, randomized strategies are more powerful than
deterministic ones. We show that our algorithms are optimal by proving matching
lower bounds.

A Design Methodology for Space-Time Adapter

Chavet,Cyrille
Coussy,Philippe
Urard,Pascal
Martin,Eric

This paper presents a solution to efficiently explore the design space of
communication adapters. In most digital signal processing (DSP) applications,
the overall architecture of the system is significantly affected by
communication architecture, so the designers need specifically optimized
adapters. By explicitly modeling these communications within an effective
graph-theoretic model and analysis framework, we automatically generate an
optimized architecture, named Space-Time AdapteR (STAR). Our design flow inputs
a C description of Input/Output data scheduling, and user requirements
(throughput, latency, parallelism...), and formalizes communication constraints
through a Resource Constraints Graph (RCG). The RCG properties enable an
efficient architecture space exploration in order to synthesize a STAR
component. The proposed approach has been tested to design an industrial data
mixing block example: an Ultra-Wideband interleaver.

Abstract Storage Devices
2007-06-19

Koenig,Robert
Maurer,Ueli
Tessaro,Stefano

A quantum storage device differs radically from a conventional physical
storage device. Its state can be set to any value in a certain (infinite) state
space, but in general every possible read operation yields only partial
information about the stored state.
  The purpose of this paper is to initiate the study of a combinatorial
abstraction, called abstract storage device (ASD), which models deterministic
storage devices with the property that only partial information about the state
can be read, but that there is a degree of freedom as to which partial
information should be retrieved.
  This concept leads to a number of interesting problems which we address, like
the reduction of one device to another device, the equivalence of devices,
direct products of devices, as well as the factorization of a device into
primitive devices. We prove that every ASD has an equivalent ASD with minimal
number of states and of possible read operations. Also, we prove that the
reducibility problem for ASD's is NP-complete, that the equivalence problem is
at least as hard as the graph isomorphism problem, and that the factorization
into binary-output devices (if it exists) is unique.

In most modern operating systems, init (as in "initialization") is the

zombies. It is also responsible for reboot and shutdown operations. This
document describes existing solutions that implement the init process and/or
init scripts in Unix-like systems. These solutions range from the legacy and
still-in-use BSD and SystemV schemes, to recent and promising schemes from
Ubuntu, Apple, Sun and independent developers. Our goal is to highlight their
focus and compare their sets of features.

Dirty-paper Coding without Channel Information at the Transmitter and Imperfect Estimation at the Receiver
2007-06-19

Piantanida,Pablo
Duhamel,Pierre

In this paper, we examine the effects of imperfect channel estimation at the
receiver and no channel knowledge at the transmitter on the capacity of the
fading Costa's channel with channel state information non-causally known at the
transmitter. We derive the optimal Dirty-paper coding (DPC) scheme and its
corresponding achievable rates with the assumption of Gaussian inputs. Our
results, for uncorrelated Rayleigh fading, provide intuitive insights on the
impact of the channel estimate and the channel characteristics (e.g. SNR,
fading process, channel training) on the achievable rates. These are useful in
practical scenarios of multiuser wireless communications (e.g. Broadcast
Channels) and information embedding applications (e.g. robust watermarking). We
also studied optimal training design adapted to each application. We provide
numerical results for a single-user fading Costa's channel with
maximum-likehood (ML) channel estimation. These illustrate an interesting
practical trade-off between the amount of training and its impact to the
interference cancellation performance using DPC scheme.

The goal of our work is to use a set of reports and extract named entities,
in our case the names of Industrial or Academic partners. Starting with an
initial list of entities, we use a first set of documents to identify syntactic
patterns that are then validated in a supervised learning phase on a set of
annotated documents. The complete collection is then explored. This approach is
similar to the ones used in data extraction from semi-structured documents
(wrappers) and do not need any linguistic resources neither a large set for
training. As our collection of documents would evolve over years, we hope that
the performance of the extraction would improve with the increased size of the
training set.

On the Outage Capacity of a Practical Decoder Using Channel Estimation Accuracy
2007-06-19

Piantanida,Pablo
Sadough,Sajad
Duhamel,Pierre

The optimal decoder achieving the outage capacity under imperfect channel
estimation is investigated. First, by searching into the family of nearest
neighbor decoders, which can be easily implemented on most practical coded
modulation systems, we derive a decoding metric that minimizes the average of
the transmission error probability over all channel estimation errors. This
metric, for arbitrary memoryless channels, achieves the capacity of a composite
(more noisy) channel. Next, according to the notion of estimation-induced
outage capacity (EIO capacity) introduced in our previous work, we characterize
maximal achievable information rates associated to the proposed decoder. The
performance of the proposed decoding metric over uncorrelated Rayleigh fading
MIMO channels is compared to both the classical mismatched maximum-likelihood
(ML) decoder and the theoretical limits given by the EIO capacity (i.e. the
best decoder in presence of channel estimation errors). Numerical results show
that the derived metric provides significant gains, in terms of achievable
information rates and bit error rate (BER), in a bit interleaved coded
modulation (BICM) framework, without introducing any additional decoding
complexity.

Martin,Eric

The re-use of pre-designed blocks is a well-known concept of the software
development. This technique has been applied to System-on-Chip (SoC) design
whose complexity and heterogeneity are growing. The re-use is made thanks to
high level components, called virtual components (IP), available in more or
less flexible forms. These components are dedicated blocks: digital signal
processing (DCT, FFT), telecommunications (Viterbi, TurboCodes),... These
blocks rest on a model of fixed architecture with very few degrees of
personalization. This rigidity is particularly true for the communication
interface whose orders of acquisition and production of data, the temporal
behavior and protocols of exchanges are fixed. The successful integration of
such an IP requires that the designer (1) synchronizes the components (2)
converts the protocols between "incompatible" blocks (3) temporizes the data to
guarantee the temporal constraints and the order of the data. This phase
remains however very manual and source of errors. Our approach proposes a
formal modeling, based on an original Ressource Compatibility Graph. The
synthesis flow is based on a set of transformations of the initial graph to
lead to an interface architecture allowing the space-time adaptation of the
data exchanges between several components.

Cache Analysis of Non-uniform Distribution Sorting Algorithms

Raman,Rajeev

We analyse the average-case cache performance of distribution sorting
algorithms in the case when keys are independently but not necessarily
uniformly distributed. The analysis is for both `in-place' and `out-of-place'
distribution sorting algorithms and is more accurate than the analysis
presented in \cite{RRESA00}. In particular, this new analysis yields tighter
upper and lower bounds when the keys are drawn from a uniform distribution.
  We use this analysis to tune the performance of the integer sorting algorithm
MSB radix sort when it is used to sort independent uniform floating-point
numbers (floats). Our tuned MSB radix sort algorithm comfortably outperforms a
cache-tuned implementations of bucketsort \cite{RR99} and Quicksort when
sorting uniform floats from $[0, 1)$.

Capacity Scaling for MIMO Two-Way Relaying
2007-06-19
2008-04-07
Vaze,Rahul
Heath,Robert W.

A multiple input multiple output (MIMO) two-way relay channel is considered,
where two sources want to exchange messages with each other using multiple
relay nodes, and both the sources and relay nodes are equipped with multiple
antennas. Both the sources are assumed to have equal number of antennas and
have perfect channel state information (CSI) for all the channels of the MIMO
two-way relay channel, whereas, each relay node is either assumed to have CSI
for its transmit and receive channel (the coherent case) or no CSI for any of
the channels (the non-coherent case). The main results in this paper are on the
scaling behavior of the capacity region of the MIMO two-way relay channel with
increasing number of relay nodes. In the coherent case, the capacity region of
the MIMO two-way relay channel is shown to scale linearly with the number of
antennas at source nodes and logarithmically with the number of relay nodes. In
the non-coherent case, the capacity region is shown to scale linearly with the
number of antennas at the source nodes and logarithmically with the signal to
noise ratio.

Outage Behavior of Discrete Memoryless Channels Under Channel Estimation Errors
2007-06-20

Piantanida,Pablo
Matz,Gerald
Duhamel,Pierre

Classically, communication systems are designed assuming perfect channel
state information at the receiver and/or transmitter. However, in many
practical situations, only an estimate of the channel is available that differs
from the true channel. We address this channel mismatch scenario by using the
notion of estimation-induced outage capacity, for which we provide an
associated coding theorem and its strong converse, assuming a discrete
memoryless channel. We illustrate our ideas via numerical simulations for
transmissions over Ricean fading channels under a quality of service (QoS)
constraint using rate-limited feedback channel and maximum likelihood (ML)
channel estimation. Our results provide intuitive insights on the impact of the
channel estimate and the channel characteristics (SNR, Ricean K-factor,
training sequence length, feedback rate, etc.) on the mean outage capacity.

A Generic Deployment Framework for Grid Computing and Distributed Applications
2007-06-20

Flissi,Areski
Merle,Philippe

Deployment of distributed applications on large systems, and especially on
grid infrastructures, becomes a more and more complex task. Grid users spend a
lot of time to prepare, install and configure middleware and application
binaries on nodes, and eventually start their applications. The problem is that
the deployment process is composed of many heterogeneous tasks that have to be
orchestrated in a specific correct order. As a consequence, the automatization
of the deployment process is currently very difficult to reach. To address this
problem, we propose in this paper a generic deployment framework allowing to
automatize the execution of heterogeneous tasks composing the whole deployment
process. Our approach is based on a reification as software components of all
required deployment mechanisms or existing tools. Grid users only have to
describe the configuration to deploy in a simple natural language instead of
programming or scripting how the deployment process is executed. As a toy
example, this framework is used to deploy CORBA component-based applications
and OpenCCM middleware on one thousand nodes of the French Grid5000
infrastructure.

Group Testing with Random Pools: optimal two-stage algorithms

We study Probabilistic Group Testing of a set of N items each of which is
defective with probability p. We focus on the double limit of small defect
probability, p<<1, and large number of variables, N>>1, taking either p->0
after $N\to\infty$ or $p=1/N^{\beta}$ with $\beta\in(0,1/2)$. In both settings
the optimal number of tests which are required to identify with certainty the
defectives via a two-stage procedure, $\bar T(N,p)$, is known to scale as
$Np|\log p|$. Here we determine the sharp asymptotic value of $\bar
T(N,p)/(Np|\log p|)$ and construct a class of two-stage algorithms over which
this optimal value is attained. This is done by choosing a proper bipartite
regular graph (of tests and variable nodes) for the first stage of the
detection. Furthermore we prove that this optimal value is also attained on
average over a random bipartite graph where all variables have the same degree,
while the tests have Poisson-distributed degrees. Finally, we improve the
existing upper and lower bound for the optimal number of tests in the case
$p=1/N^{\beta}$ with $\beta\in[1/2,1)$.

In densely populated urban areas WiFi routers form a tightly interconnected
proximity network that can be exploited as a substrate for the spreading of
malware able to launch massive fraudulent attack and affect entire urban areas
WiFi networks. In this paper we consider several scenarios for the deployment
of malware that spreads solely over the wireless channel of major urban areas
in the US. We develop an epidemiological model that takes into consideration
prevalent security flaws on these routers. The spread of such a contagion is
simulated on real-world data for geo-referenced wireless routers. We uncover a
major weakness of WiFi networks in that most of the simulated scenarios show
tens of thousands of routers infected in as little time as two weeks, with the
majority of the infections occurring in the first 24 to 48 hours. We indicate
possible containment and prevention measure to limit the eventual harm of such
an attack.

This report specifies an observational semantics and gives an original

general, considered as rather obscure and difficult to use. The proposed formal
presentation of a trace constitutes a simple and pedagogical approach for
teaching Prolog or for implementing Prolog tracers. It constitutes a form of
declarative specification for the tracers. Our approach highlights qualities of
the box model which made its success, but also its drawbacks and limits. As a
matter of fact, the presented semantics is only one example to illustrate
general problems relating to tracers and observing processes. Observing
processes know, from observed processes, only their traces. The issue is then
to be able to reconstitute by the sole analysis of the trace the main part of
the observed process, and if possible, without any loss of information.

As product complexity and marketing competition increase, a collaborative
product development is necessary for companies which develop high quality
products in short lead-times. To support product actors from different fields,
disciplines, and locations, wishing to exchange and share information, the
representation of the actors' viewpoints is the underlying requirement of the
collaborative product development. The actors' viewpoints approach was designed
to provide an organisational framework following the actors' perspectives in
the collaboration, and their relationships, could be explicitly gathered and
formatted. The approach acknowledges the inevitability of multiple integration
of product information as different views, promotes gathering of actors'
interests, and encourages retrieved adequate information while providing
support for integration through PLM and/or SCM collaboration. In this paper, a
solution for neutral viewpoints representation is proposed. The product,
process, and organisation information models are seriatim discussed. A series
of issues referring to the viewpoints representation are discussed in detail.
Based on XML standard, taking cyclone vessel as an example, an application case

We analyze a MIMO DS-CDMA channel with a general multiuser detector including

limit the MIMO DS-CDMA channel with the multiuser detector is decoupled into a
bank of single-user SIMO Gaussian channels if a spatial spreading scheme is
employed. On the other hand, it is decoupled into a bank of single-user MIMO
Gaussian channels if a spatial spreading scheme is not employed. The spectral
efficiency of the MIMO DS-CDMA channel with the spatial spreading scheme is
comparable with that of the MIMO DS-CDMA channel using an optimal space-time
block code without the spatial spreading scheme. In the case of the QPSK data
modulation scheme the spectral efficiency of the MIMO DS-CDMA channel with the
MMSE detector shows {\it waterfall} behavior and is very close to the
corresponding sum capacity when the system load is just below the transition
point of the {\it waterfall} behavior. Our result implies that the performance
of a multiuser detector taking the data modulation scheme into consideration
can be far superior to that of linear multiuser detectors.

A tutorial on conformal prediction
2007-06-21

Shafer,Glenn
Vovk,Vladimir

Conformal prediction uses past experience to determine precise levels of
confidence in new predictions. Given an error probability $\epsilon$, together
with a method that makes a prediction $\hat{y}$ of a label $y$, it produces a
set of labels, typically containing $\hat{y}$, that also contains $y$ with
probability $1-\epsilon$. Conformal prediction can be applied to any method for
producing $\hat{y}$: a nearest-neighbor method, a support-vector machine, ridge
regression, etc.
  Conformal prediction is designed for an on-line setting in which labels are
predicted successively, each one being revealed before the next is predicted.
The most novel and valuable feature of conformal prediction is that if the
successive examples are sampled independently from the same distribution, then
the successive predictions will be right $1-\epsilon$ of the time, even though
they are based on an accumulating dataset rather than on independent datasets.
  In addition to the model under which successive examples are sampled
independently, other on-line compression models can also use conformal
prediction. The widely used Gaussian linear model is one of these.
  This tutorial presents a self-contained account of the theory of conformal
prediction and works through several numerical examples. A more comprehensive
treatment of the topic is provided in "Algorithmic Learning in a Random World",
by Vladimir Vovk, Alex Gammerman, and Glenn Shafer (Springer, 2005).

On Canonical Forms of Complete Problems via First-order Projections
2007-06-22

Borges,Nerio
Bonet,Blai

The class of problems complete for NP via first-order reductions is known to
be characterized by existential second-order sentences of a fixed form. All
such sentences are built around the so-called generalized IS-form of the
sentence that defines Independent-Set. This result can also be understood as
that every sentence that defines a NP-complete problem P can be decomposed in
two disjuncts such that the first one characterizes a fragment of P as hard as
Independent-Set and the second the rest of P. That is, a decomposition that
divides every such sentence into a quotient and residue modulo Independent-Set.
  In this paper, we show that this result can be generalized over a wide
collection of complexity classes, including the so-called nice classes.
Moreover, we show that such decomposition can be done for any complete problem
with respect to the given class, and that two such decompositions are
non-equivalent in general. Interestingly, our results are based on simple and
well-known properties of first-order reductions.ow that this result can be
generalized over a wide collection of complexity classes, including the

The Impact of Channel Feedback on Opportunistic Relay Selection for Hybrid-ARQ in Wireless Networks
2007-06-23
2008-03-31
Lo,Caleb K.
Heath,Robert W.
Vishwanath,Sriram

This paper presents a decentralized relay selection protocol for a dense
wireless network and describes channel feedback strategies that improve its
performance. The proposed selection protocol supports hybrid
automatic-repeat-request transmission where relays forward parity information
to the destination in the event of a decoding error. Channel feedback is
employed for refining the relay selection process and for selecting an
appropriate transmission mode in a proposed adaptive modulation transmission
framework. An approximation of the throughput of the proposed adaptive
modulation strategy is presented, and the dependence of the throughput on
system parameters such as the relay contention probability and the adaptive
modulation switching point is illustrated via maximization of this
approximation. Simulations show that the throughput of the proposed selection
strategy is comparable to that yielded by a centralized selection approach that
relies on geographic information.

NP by means of lifts and shadows
2007-06-23

Kun,Gabor
Nesetril,Jaroslav

We show that every NP problem is polynomially equivalent to a simple
combinatorial problem: the membership problem for a special class of digraphs.
These classes are defined by means of shadows (projections) and by finitely
many forbidden colored (lifted) subgraphs. Our characterization is motivated by
the analysis of syntactical subclasses with the full computational power of NP,
which were first studied by Feder and Vardi.
  Our approach applies to many combinatorial problems and it induces the
characterization of coloring problems (CSP) defined by means of shadows. This
turns out to be related to homomorphism dualities. We prove that a class of
digraphs (relational structures) defined by finitely many forbidden colored
subgraphs (i.e. lifted substructures) is a CSP class if and only if all the the
forbidden structures are homomorphically equivalent to trees. We show a
surprising richness of coloring problems when restricted to most frequent graph
classes. Using results of Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il and Ossona de Mendez for bounded
expansion classes (which include bounded degree and proper minor closed
classes) we prove that the restriction of every class defined as the shadow of
finitely many colored subgraphs equals to the restriction of a coloring (CSP)
class.

Hypocomputation

Love,David

Hypercomputational formal theories will, clearly, be both structurally and
foundationally different from the formal theories underpinning computational
theories. However, many of the maps that might guide us into this strange realm
have been lost. So little work has been done recently in the area of
metamathematics, and so many of the previous results have been folded into
other theories, that we are in danger of loosing an appreciation of the broader
structure of formal theories. As an aid to those looking to develop
hypercomputational theories, we will briefly survey the known landmarks both
inside and outside the borders of computational theory. We will not focus in
this paper on why the structure of formal theory looks the way it does. Instead
we will focus on what this structure looks like, moving from hypocomputational,
through traditional computational theories, and then beyond to
hypercomputational theories.

Tight Bounds on the Average Length, Entropy, and Redundancy of Anti-Uniform Huffman Codes

In this paper we consider the class of anti-uniform Huffman codes and derive
tight lower and upper bounds on the average length, entropy, and redundancy of
such codes in terms of the alphabet size of the source. The Fibonacci
distributions are introduced which play a fundamental role in AUH codes. It is
shown that such distributions maximize the average length and the entropy of
the code for a given alphabet size. Another previously known bound on the
entropy for given average length follows immediately from our results.

Approximately-Universal Space-Time Codes for the Parallel, Multi-Block and Cooperative-Dynamic-Decode-and-Forward Channels

Elia,Petros
Kumar,P. Vijay

Explicit codes are constructed that achieve the diversity-multiplexing gain
tradeoff of the cooperative-relay channel under the dynamic decode-and-forward
protocol for any network size and for all numbers of transmit and receive
antennas at the relays.
  A particularly simple code construction that makes use of the Alamouti code
as a basic building block is provided for the single relay case.
  Along the way, we prove that space-time codes previously constructed in the
literature for the block-fading and parallel channels are approximately
universal, i.e., they achieve the DMT for any fading distribution. It is shown
how approximate universality of these codes leads to the first DMT-optimum code
construction for the general, MIMO-OFDM channel.

There Exist some Omega-Powers of Any Borel Rank
2007-06-25

Lecomte,Dominique
Finkel,Olivier

Omega-powers of finitary languages are languages of infinite words
(omega-languages) in the form V^omega, where V is a finitary language over a
finite alphabet X. They appear very naturally in the characterizaton of regular
or context-free omega-languages. Since the set of infinite words over a finite
alphabet X can be equipped with the usual Cantor topology, the question of the
topological complexity of omega-powers of finitary languages naturally arises
and has been posed by Niwinski (1990), Simonnet (1992) and Staiger (1997). It
has been recently proved that for each integer n > 0, there exist some
omega-powers of context free languages which are Pi^0_n-complete Borel sets,
that there exists a context free language L such that L^omega is analytic but
not Borel, and that there exists a finitary language V such that V^omega is a
Borel set of infinite rank. But it was still unknown which could be the
possible infinite Borel ranks of omega-powers. We fill this gap here, proving
the following very surprising result which shows that omega-powers exhibit a
great topological complexity: for each non-null countable ordinal alpha, there
exist some Sigma^0_alpha-complete omega-powers, and some Pi^0_alpha-complete
omega-powers.

stdchk: A Checkpoint Storage System for Desktop Grid Computing
2007-06-24

Kiswany,Samer Al
Ripeanu,Matei
Vazhkudai,Sudharshan S.
Gharaibeh,Abdullah

Checkpointing is an indispensable technique to provide fault tolerance for
long-running high-throughput applications like those running on desktop grids.
This paper argues that a dedicated checkpoint storage system, optimized to
operate in these environments, can offer multiple benefits: reduce the load on
a traditional file system, offer high-performance through specialization, and,
finally, optimize data management by taking into account checkpoint application
semantics. Such a storage system can present a unifying abstraction to
checkpoint operations, while hiding the fact that there are no dedicated
resources to store the checkpoint data. We prototype stdchk, a checkpoint
storage system that uses scavenged disk space from participating desktops to
build a low-cost storage system, offering a traditional file system interface
for easy integration with applications. This paper presents the stdchk
architecture, key performance optimizations, support for incremental
checkpointing, and increased data availability. Our evaluation confirms that
the stdchk approach is viable in a desktop grid setting and offers a low cost
storage system with desirable performance characteristics: high write
throughput and reduced storage space and network effort to save checkpoint
images.

Experimental Algorithm for the Maximum Independent Set Problem

Plotnikov,Anatoly D.

We develop an experimental algorithm for the exact solving of the maximum
independent set problem. The algorithm consecutively finds the maximal
independent sets of vertices in an arbitrary undirected graph such that the
next such set contains more elements than the preceding one. For this purpose,
we use a technique, developed by Ford and Fulkerson for the finite partially
ordered sets, in particular, their method for partition of a poset into the
minimum number of chains with finding the maximum antichain. In the process of
solving, a special digraph is constructed, and a conjecture is formulated
concerning properties of such digraph. This allows to offer of the solution
algorithm. Its theoretical estimation of running time equals to is $O(n^{8})$,
where $n$ is the number of graph vertices. The offered algorithm was tested by
a program on random graphs. The testing the confirms correctness of the
algorithm.

Scale-sensitive Psi-dimensions: the Capacity Measures for Classifiers Taking Values in R^Q

Bounds on the risk play a crucial role in statistical learning theory. They
usually involve as capacity measure of the model studied the VC dimension or
one of its extensions. In classification, such "VC dimensions" exist for models
taking values in {0, 1}, {1,..., Q} and R. We introduce the generalizations
appropriate for the missing case, the one of models with values in R^Q. This
provides us with a new guaranteed risk for M-SVMs which appears superior to the
existing one.

Optimal Constellations for the Low SNR Noncoherent MIMO Block Rayleigh Fading Channel
2007-06-25
2008-09-22
Srinivasan,Shivratna Giri
Varanasi,Mahesh K.

Reliable communication over the discrete-input/continuous-output noncoherent
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) Rayleigh block fading channel is
considered when the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) per degree of freedom is low.
Two key problems are posed and solved to obtain the optimum discrete input. In
both problems, the average and peak power per space-time slot of the input
constellation are constrained. In the first one, the peak power to average
power ratio (PPAPR) of the input constellation is held fixed, while in the
second problem, the peak power is fixed independently of the average power. In
the first PPAPR-constrained problem, the mutual information, which grows as
O(SNR^2), is maximized up to second order in SNR. In the second
peak-constrained problem, where the mutual information behaves as O(SNR), the
structure of constellations that are optimal up to first order, or
equivalently, that minimize energy/bit, are explicitly characterized.
Furthermore, among constellations that are first-order optimal, those that
maximize the mutual information up to second order, or equivalently, the
wideband slope, are characterized. In both PPAPR-constrained and
peak-constrained problems, the optimal constellations are obtained in
closed-form as solutions to non-convex optimizations, and interestingly, they
are found to be identical. Due to its special structure, the common solution is
referred to as Space Time Orthogonal Rank one Modulation, or STORM. In both
problems, it is seen that STORM provides a sharp characterization of the
behavior of noncoherent MIMO capacity.

Order-Invariant MSO is Stronger than Counting MSO in the Finite
2007-06-26
2008-03-20
Ganzow,Tobias
Rubin,Sasha

We compare the expressiveness of two extensions of monadic second-order logic
(MSO) over the class of finite structures. The first, counting monadic
second-order logic (CMSO), extends MSO with first-order modulo-counting
quantifiers, allowing the expression of queries like ``the number of elements
in the structure is even''. The second extension allows the use of an
additional binary predicate, not contained in the signature of the queried
structure, that must be interpreted as an arbitrary linear order on its
universe, obtaining order-invariant MSO.
  While it is straightforward that every CMSO formula can be translated into an
equivalent order-invariant MSO formula, the converse had not yet been settled.
Courcelle showed that for restricted classes of structures both order-invariant
MSO and CMSO are equally expressive, but conjectured that, in general,
order-invariant MSO is stronger than CMSO.
  We affirm this conjecture by presenting a class of structures that is
order-invariantly definable in MSO but not definable in CMSO.

Secure Nested Codes for Type II Wiretap Channels
2007-06-25

Liu,Ruoheng
Liang,Yingbin
Poor,H. Vincent
Spasojevic,Predrag

This paper considers the problem of secure coding design for a type II
wiretap channel, where the main channel is noiseless and the eavesdropper
channel is a general binary-input symmetric-output memoryless channel. The
proposed secure error-correcting code has a nested code structure. Two secure
nested coding schemes are studied for a type II Gaussian wiretap channel. The
nesting is based on cosets of a good code sequence for the first scheme and on
cosets of the dual of a good code sequence for the second scheme. In each case,
the corresponding achievable rate-equivocation pair is derived based on the
threshold behavior of good code sequences. The two secure coding schemes
together establish an achievable rate-equivocation region, which almost covers
the secrecy capacity-equivocation region in this case study. The proposed
secure coding scheme is extended to a type II binary symmetric wiretap channel.
A new achievable perfect secrecy rate, which improves upon the previously
reported result by Thangaraj et al., is derived for this channel.

This paper considers the problem of secret communication over a multiple
access channel with generalized feedback. Two trusted users send independent
confidential messages to an intended receiver, in the presence of a passive
eavesdropper. In this setting, an active cooperation between two trusted users
is enabled through using channel feedback in order to improve the communication
efficiency. Based on rate-splitting and decode-and-forward strategies,
achievable secrecy rate regions are derived for both discrete memoryless and
Gaussian channels. Results show that channel feedback improves the achievable
secrecy rates.

Dynamic Exploration of Networks: from general principles to the traceroute process

proposed, both for single-source and multiple-source cases, and applied to the
specific example of the traceroute exploration of networks. Our results provide
a qualitative improvement in the understanding of dynamical sampling and of the
interplay between dynamics and topology in large networks like the Internet.

Java Components Vulnerabilities - An Experimental Classification Targeted at the OSGi Platform

The OSGi Platform finds a growing interest in two different applications
domains: embedded systems, and applications servers. However, the security
properties of this platform are hardly studied, which is likely to hinder its
use in production systems. This is all the more important that the dynamic
aspect of OSGi-based applications, that can be extended at runtime, make them
vulnerable to malicious code injection. We therefore perform a systematic audit
of the OSGi platform so as to build a vulnerability catalog that intends to
reference OSGi Vulnerabilities originating in the Core Specification, and in
behaviors related to the use of the Java language. Standard Services are not
considered. To support this audit, a Semi-formal Vulnerability Pattern is
defined, that enables to uniquely characterize fundamental properties for each
vulnerability, to include verbose description in the pattern, to reference
known security protections, and to track the implementation status of the
proof-of-concept OSGi Bundles that exploit the vulnerability. Based on the
analysis of the catalog, a robust OSGi Platform is built, and recommendations
are made to enhance the OSGi Specifications.

Design of optimal convolutional codes for joint decoding of correlated sources in wireless sensor networks
2007-06-26

Abrardo,A.

We consider a wireless sensors network scenario where two nodes detect
correlated sources and deliver them to a central collector via a wireless link.
Differently from the Slepian-Wolf approach to distributed source coding, in the
proposed scenario the sensing nodes do not perform any pre-compression of the
sensed data. Original data are instead independently encoded by means of
low-complexity convolutional codes. The decoder performs joint decoding with
the aim of exploiting the inherent correlation between the transmitted sources.
Complexity at the decoder is kept low thanks to the use of an iterative joint
decoding scheme, where the output of each decoder is fed to the other decoder's
input as a-priori information. For such scheme, we derive a novel analytical
framework for evaluating an upper bound of joint-detection packet error
probability and for deriving the optimum coding scheme. Experimental results
confirm the validity of the analytical framework, and show that recursive codes
allow a noticeable performance gain with respect to non-recursive coding
schemes. Moreover, the proposed recursive coding scheme allows to approach the
ideal Slepian-Wolf scheme performance in AWGN channel, and to clearly
outperform it over fading channels on account of diversity gain due to
correlation of information.

Opportunistic Scheduling and Beamforming for MIMO-SDMA Downlink Systems with Linear Combining

Opportunistic scheduling and beamforming schemes are proposed for multiuser
MIMO-SDMA downlink systems with linear combining in this work. Signals received
from all antennas of each mobile terminal (MT) are linearly combined to improve
the {\em effective} signal-to-noise-interference ratios (SINRs). By exploiting
limited feedback on the effective SINRs, the base station (BS) schedules
simultaneous data transmission on multiple beams to the MTs with the largest
effective SINRs. Utilizing the extreme value theory, we derive the asymptotic
system throughputs and scaling laws for the proposed scheduling and beamforming
schemes with different linear combining techniques. Computer simulations
confirm that the proposed schemes can substantially improve the system
throughput.

Minimum Sum Edge Colorings of Multicycles

In the minimum sum edge coloring problem, we aim to assign natural numbers to
edges of a graph, so that adjacent edges receive different numbers, and the sum
of the numbers assigned to the edges is minimum. The {\em chromatic edge
strength} of a graph is the minimum number of colors required in a minimum sum
edge coloring of this graph. We study the case of multicycles, defined as
cycles with parallel edges, and give a closed-form expression for the chromatic
edge strength of a multicycle, thereby extending a theorem due to Berge. It is
shown that the minimum sum can be achieved with a number of colors equal to the
chromatic index. We also propose simple algorithms for finding a minimum sum
edge coloring of a multicycle. Finally, these results are generalized to a
large family of minimum cost coloring problems.

Approximations of Lovasz extensions and their induced interaction index
2007-06-26

Marichal,Jean-Luc
Mathonet,Pierre

The Lovasz extension of a pseudo-Boolean function $f : \{0,1\}^n \to R$ is
defined on each simplex of the standard triangulation of $[0,1]^n$ as the
unique affine function $\hat f : [0,1]^n \to R$ that interpolates $f$ at the
$n+1$ vertices of the simplex. Its degree is that of the unique multilinear
polynomial that expresses $f$. In this paper we investigate the least squares
approximation problem of an arbitrary Lovasz extension $\hat f$ by Lovasz
extensions of (at most) a specified degree. We derive explicit expressions of
these approximations. The corresponding approximation problem for
pseudo-Boolean functions was investigated by Hammer and Holzman (1992) and then
solved explicitly by Grabisch, Marichal, and Roubens (2000), giving rise to an
alternative definition of Banzhaf interaction index. Similarly we introduce a
new interaction index from approximations of $\hat f$ and we present some of
its properties. It turns out that its corresponding power index identifies with
the power index introduced by Grabisch and Labreuche (2001).

A Comparison of Push and Pull Techniques for Ajax

Ajax applications are designed to have high user interactivity and low
user-perceived latency. Real-time dynamic web data such as news headlines,
stock tickers, and auction updates need to be propagated to the users as soon
as possible. However, Ajax still suffers from the limitations of the Web's
request/response architecture which prevents servers from pushing real-time
dynamic web data. Such applications usually use a pull style to obtain the
latest updates, where the client actively requests the changes based on a
predefined interval. It is possible to overcome this limitation by adopting a
push style of interaction where the server broadcasts data when a change occurs
on the server side. Both these options have their own trade-offs. This paper
explores the fundamental limits of browser-based applications and analyzes push
solutions for Ajax technology. It also shows the results of an empirical study
comparing push and pull.

for different-speed processors, which turns out to be NP-hard. We provide

Wavelets deals with coordination among processes which are at most r hops away

solution requires no underlying structure and works in arbritrary anonymous
networks, i.e., no process identifier is required. Moreover, our solution works
under any (even unfair) daemon. Next, we use the wavelet scheme to design
self-stabilizing layer clocks. We show that they provide an efficient device in
the design of local coordination problems at distance r, i.e., r-barrier
synchronization and r-local resource allocation (LRA) such as r-local mutual
exclusion (LME), r-group mutual exclusion (GME), and r-Reader/Writers. Some
solutions to the r-LRA problem (e.g., r-LME) also provide transformers to

propagations in such networks. To understand the dynamic of worm interactions
and its performance, we mathematically model worm interactions based on major
worm interaction factors including worm interaction types, network
characteristics, and node characteristics using ordinary differential equations
and analyze their effects on our proposed metrics. We validate our proposed
model using extensive synthetic and trace-driven simulations. We find that, all
worm interaction factors significantly affect the pattern of worm propagations.
For example, immunization linearly decreases the infection of susceptible nodes
while on-off behavior only impacts the duration of infection. Using realistic
mobile network measurements, we find that encounters are bursty, multi-group
and non-uniform. The trends from the trace-driven simulations are consistent
with the model, in general. Immunization and timely deployment seem to be the
most effective to counter the worm attacks in such scenarios while cooperation
may help in a specific case. These findings provide insight that we hope would
aid to develop counter-worm protocols in future encounter-based networks.

Scheduling multiple divisible loads on a linear processor network
2007-06-27
2007-06-28
Gallet,Matthieu
Robert,Yves
Vivien,Frédéric

Min, Veeravalli, and Barlas have recently proposed strategies to minimize the
overall execution time of one or several divisible loads on a heterogeneous
linear network, using one or more installments. We show on a very simple
example that their approach does not always produce a solution and that, when
it does, the solution is often suboptimal. We also show how to find an optimal
schedule for any instance, once the number of installments per load is given.
Then, we formally state that any optimal schedule has an infinite number of
installments under a linear cost model as the one assumed in the original
papers. Therefore, such a cost model cannot be used to design practical
multi-installment strategies. Finally, through extensive simulations we
confirmed that the best solution is always produced by the linear programming
approach, while solutions of the original papers can be far away from the
optimal.

PSPACE Bounds for Rank-1 Modal Logics
2007-06-27

Schröder,Lutz
Pattinson,Dirk

For lack of general algorithmic methods that apply to wide classes of logics,
establishing a complexity bound for a given modal logic is often a laborious
task. The present work is a step towards a general theory of the complexity of
modal logics. Our main result is that all rank-1 logics enjoy a shallow model
property and thus are, under mild assumptions on the format of their
axiomatisation, in PSPACE. This leads to a unified derivation of tight
PSPACE-bounds for a number of logics including K, KD, coalition logic, graded
modal logic, majority logic, and probabilistic modal logic. Our generic
algorithm moreover finds tableau proofs that witness pleasant proof-theoretic
properties including a weak subformula property. This generality is made
possible by a coalgebraic semantics, which conveniently abstracts from the
details of a given model class and thus allows covering a broad range of logics
in a uniform way.

Getting More From Your Multicore: Exploiting OpenMP From An Open Source Numerical Scripting Language
2007-06-27

Noble,Michael S.

We introduce SLIRP, a module generator for the S-Lang numerical scripting
language, with a focus on its vectorization capabilities. We demonstrate how
both SLIRP and S-Lang were easily adapted to exploit the inherent parallelism
of high-level mathematical languages with OpenMP, allowing general users to
employ tightly-coupled multiprocessors in scriptable research calculations
while requiring no special knowledge of parallel programming. Motivated by
examples in the ISIS astrophysical modeling & analysis tool, performance
figures are presented for several machine and compiler configurations,
demonstrating beneficial speedups for real-world operations.

Some Quantitative Aspects of Fractional Computability
2007-06-27

Kapovich,Ilya
Schupp,Paul

Motivated by results on generic-case complexity in group theory, we apply the
ideas of effective Baire category and effective measure theory to study
complexity classes of functions which are "fractionally computable" by a
partial algorithm. For this purpose it is crucial to specify an allowable
effective density, $\delta$, of convergence for a partial algorithm. The set
$\mathcal{FC}(\delta)$ consists of all total functions $ f: \Sigma^\ast \to
\{0,1 \}$ where $\Sigma$ is a finite alphabet with $|\Sigma| \ge 2$ which are
"fractionally computable at density $\delta$". The space $\mathcal{FC}(\delta)
$ is effectively of the second category while any fractional complexity class,
defined using $\delta$ and any computable bound $\beta$ with respect to an
abstract Blum complexity measure, is effectively meager. A remarkable result of
Kautz and Miltersen shows that relative to an algorithmically random oracle
$A$, the relativized class $\mathcal{NP}^A$ does not have effective polynomial
measure zero in $\mathcal{E}^A$, the relativization of strict exponential time.
We define the class $\mathcal{UFP}^A$ of all languages which are fractionally
decidable in polynomial time at ``a uniform rate'' by algorithms with an oracle
for $A$. We show that this class does have effective polynomial measure zero in
$\mathcal{E}^A$ for every oracle $A$. Thus relaxing the requirement of
polynomial time decidability to hold only for a fraction of possible inputs
does not compensate for the power of nondeterminism in the case of random
oracles.

Radix Sorting With No Extra Space
2007-06-27

Franceschini,Gianni
Muthukrishnan,S.
Patrascu,Mihai

It is well known that n integers in the range [1,n^c] can be sorted in O(n)
time in the RAM model using radix sorting. More generally, integers in any
range [1,U] can be sorted in O(n sqrt{loglog n}) time. However, these
algorithms use O(n) words of extra memory. Is this necessary?
  We present a simple, stable, integer sorting algorithm for words of size
O(log n), which works in O(n) time and uses only O(1) words of extra memory on
a RAM model. This is the integer sorting case most useful in practice. We
extend this result with same bounds to the case when the keys are read-only,
which is of theoretical interest. Another interesting question is the case of
arbitrary c. Here we present a black-box transformation from any RAM sorting
algorithm to a sorting algorithm which uses only O(1) extra space and has the
same running time. This settles the complexity of in-place sorting in terms of
the complexity of sorting.

Heuristics for Network Coding in Wireless Networks
2007-06-28
2007-07-04
Cho,Song Yean
Adjih,Cédric
Jacquet,Philippe

Multicast is a central challenge for emerging multi-hop wireless
architectures such as wireless mesh networks, because of its substantial cost
in terms of bandwidth. In this report, we study one specific case of multicast:
broadcasting, sending data from one source to all nodes, in a multi-hop
wireless network. The broadcast we focus on is based on network coding, a
promising avenue for reducing cost; previous work of ours showed that the
performance of network coding with simple heuristics is asymptotically optimal:
each transmission is beneficial to nearly every receiver. This is for
homogenous and large networks of the plan. But for small, sparse or for
inhomogeneous networks, some additional heuristics are required. This report
proposes such additional new heuristics (for selecting rates) for broadcasting
with network coding. Our heuristics are intended to use only simple local
topology information. We detail the logic of the heuristics, and with
experimental results, we illustrate the behavior of the heuristics, and
demonstrate their excellent performance.

User driven applications - new design paradigm
2007-06-28

Andreyev,Sergey

Programs for complicated engineering and scientific tasks always have to deal
with a problem of showing numerous graphical results. The limits of the screen
space and often opposite requirements from different users are the cause of the
infinite discussions between designers and users, but the source of this
ongoing conflict is not in the level of interface design, but in the basic
principle of current graphical output: user may change some views and details,
but in general the output view is absolutely defined and fixed by the
developer. Author was working for several years on the algorithm that will
allow eliminating this problem thus allowing stepping from designer-driven
applications to user-driven. Such type of applications in which user is
deciding what, when and how to show on the screen, is the dream of scientists
and engineers working on the analysis of the most complicated tasks. The new
paradigm is based on movable and resizable graphics, and such type of graphics
can be widely used not only for scientific and engineering applications.

Unison as a Self-Stabilizing Wave Stream Algorithm in Asynchronous Anonymous Networks
2007-06-28

Boulinier,Christian

How to pass from local to global scales in anonymous networks? How to
organize a selfstabilizing propagation of information with feedback. From the
Angluin impossibility results, we cannot elect a leader in a general anonymous
network. Thus, it is impossible to build a rooted spanning tree. Many problems
can only be solved by probabilistic methods. In this paper we show how to use
Unison to design a self-stabilizing barrier synchronization in an anonymous
network. We show that the commuication structure of this barrier
synchronization designs a self-stabilizing wave-stream, or pipelining wave, in
anonymous networks. We introduce two variants of Wave: the strong waves and the
wavelets. A strong wave can be used to solve the idempotent r-operator
parametrized computation problem. A wavelet deals with k-distance computation.
We show how to use Unison to design a self-stabilizing wave stream, a
self-stabilizing strong wave stream and a self-stabilizing wavelet stream.

Theory of Finite or Infinite Trees Revisited
2007-06-28

Djelloul,Khalil
Dao,Thi-bich-hanh
Fruehwirth,Thom

We present in this paper a first-order axiomatization of an extended theory
$T$ of finite or infinite trees, built on a signature containing an infinite
set of function symbols and a relation $\fini(t)$ which enables to distinguish
between finite or infinite trees. We show that $T$ has at least one model and
prove its completeness by giving not only a decision procedure, but a full
first-order constraint solver which gives clear and explicit solutions for any
first-order constraint satisfaction problem in $T$. The solver is given in the
form of 16 rewriting rules which transform any first-order constraint $\phi$
into an equivalent disjunction $\phi$ of simple formulas such that $\phi$ is
either the formula $\true$ or the formula $\false$ or a formula having at least
one free variable, being equivalent neither to $\true$ nor to $\false$ and
where the solutions of the free variables are expressed in a clear and explicit
way. The correctness of our rules implies the completeness of $T$. We also
describe an implementation of our algorithm in CHR (Constraint Handling Rules)
and compare the performance with an implementation in C++ and that of a recent
decision procedure for decomposable theories.

A Robust Linguistic Platform for Efficient and Domain specific Web Content Analysis

Hamon,Thierry

Derivière,Julien

Web semantic access in specific domains calls for specialized search engines
with enhanced semantic querying and indexing capacities, which pertain both to
information retrieval (IR) and to information extraction (IE). A rich
linguistic analysis is required either to identify the relevant semantic units
to index and weight them according to linguistic specific statistical
distribution, or as the basis of an information extraction process. Recent
developments make Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques reliable enough
to process large collections of documents and to enrich them with semantic
annotations. This paper focuses on the design and the development of a text
processing platform, Ogmios, which has been developed in the ALVIS project. The
Ogmios platform exploits existing NLP modules and resources, which may be tuned
to specific domains and produces linguistically annotated documents. We show
how the three constraints of genericity, domain semantic awareness and
performance can be handled all together.

Non-atomic Games for Multi-User Systems
2007-06-30

Bonneau,Nicolas
Debbah,Mérouane
Altman,Eitan
Hjørungnes,Are

In this contribution, the performance of a multi-user system is analyzed in
the context of frequency selective fading channels. Using game theoretic tools,
a useful framework is provided in order to determine the optimal power
allocation when users know only their own channel (while perfect channel state
information is assumed at the base station). We consider the realistic case of
frequency selective channels for uplink CDMA. This scenario illustrates the
case of decentralized schemes, where limited information on the network is
available at the terminal. Various receivers are considered, namely the Matched
filter, the MMSE filter and the optimum filter. The goal of this paper is to
derive simple expressions for the non-cooperative Nash equilibrium as the
number of mobiles becomes large and the spreading length increases. To that end
two asymptotic methodologies are combined. The first is asymptotic random
matrix theory which allows us to obtain explicit expressions of the impact of
all other mobiles on any given tagged mobile. The second is the theory of
non-atomic games which computes good approximations of the Nash equilibrium as
the number of mobiles grows.

Location and Spectral Estimation of Weak Wave Packets on Noise Background

Bunyak,O.

The method of location and spectral estimation of weak signals on a noise
background is being considered. The method is based on the optimized on order
and noise dispersion autoregressive model of a sought signal. A new approach of
model order determination is being offered. Available estimation of the noise
dispersion is close to the real one. The optimized model allows to define
function of empirical data spectral and dynamic features changes. The analysis
of the signal as dynamic invariant in respect of the linear shift
transformation yields the function of model consistency. Use of these both
functions enables to detect short-time and nonstationary wave packets at signal
to noise ratio as from -20 dB and above.

Selection Relaying at Low Signal to Noise Ratios

Performance of cooperative diversity schemes at Low Signal to Noise Ratios
(LSNR) was recently studied by Avestimehr et. al. [1] who emphasized the

been pointed out that continuous energy transfer to the channel is necessary
for achieving the max-flow min-cut bound at LSNR. Motivated by this we propose
the use of Selection Decode and Forward (SDF) at LSNR and analyze its
performance in terms of the outage probability. We also propose an energy
optimization scheme which further brings down the outage probability.

A Generalized Sampling Theorem for Frequency Localized Signals
2007-07-02
2009-04-15
Hammerich,Edwin

A generalized sampling theorem for frequency localized signals is presented.
The generalization in the proposed model of sampling is twofold: (1) It applies
to various prefilters effecting a "soft" bandlimitation, (2) an approximate
reconstruction from sample values rather than a perfect one is obtained (though
the former might be "practically perfect" in many cases). For an arbitrary
finite-energy signal the frequency localization is performed by a prefilter
realizing a crosscorrelation with a function of prescribed properties. The
range of the filter, the so-called localization space, is described in some
detail. Regular sampling is applied and a reconstruction formula is given. For
the reconstruction error a general error estimate is derived and connections
between a critical sampling interval and notions of "soft bandwidth" for the
prefilter are indicated. Examples based on the sinc-function, Gaussian
functions and B-splines are discussed.

Interference Alignment and the Degrees of Freedom for the K User Interference Channel
2007-07-03
2007-07-10
Cadambe,Viveck R.
Jafar,Syed A.

While the best known outerbound for the K user interference channel states
that there cannot be more than K/2 degrees of freedom, it has been conjectured
that in general the constant interference channel with any number of users has
only one degree of freedom. In this paper, we explore the spatial degrees of
freedom per orthogonal time and frequency dimension for the K user wireless
interference channel where the channel coefficients take distinct values across
frequency slots but are fixed in time. We answer five closely related
questions. First, we show that K/2 degrees of freedom can be achieved by
channel design, i.e. if the nodes are allowed to choose the best constant,
finite and nonzero channel coefficient values. Second, we show that if channel
coefficients can not be controlled by the nodes but are selected by nature,
i.e., randomly drawn from a continuous distribution, the total number of
spatial degrees of freedom for the K user interference channel is almost surely
K/2 per orthogonal time and frequency dimension. Thus, only half the spatial
degrees of freedom are lost due to distributed processing of transmitted and
received signals on the interference channel. Third, we show that interference
alignment and zero forcing suffice to achieve all the degrees of freedom in all
cases. Fourth, we show that the degrees of freedom $D$ directly lead to an
$\mathcal{O}(1)$ capacity characterization of the form
$C(SNR)=D\log(1+SNR)+\mathcal{O}(1)$ for the multiple access channel, the
broadcast channel, the 2 user interference channel, the 2 user MIMO X channel
and the 3 user interference channel with M>1 antennas at each node. Fifth, we
characterize the degree of freedom benefits from cognitive sharing of messages
on the 3 user interference channel.

In this note, we develop stock option price approximations for a model which
takes both the risk o default and the stochastic volatility into account. We
also let the intensity of defaults be influenced by the volatility. We show
that it might be possible to infer the risk neutral default intensity from the
stock option prices. Our option price approximation has a rich implied
volatility surface structure and fits the data implied volatility well. Our
calibration exercise shows that an effective hazard rate from bonds issued by a
company can be used to explain the implied volatility skew of the implied
volatility of the option prices issued by the same company.

The Desktop Grid offers solutions to overcome several challenges and to
answer increasingly needs of scientific computing. Its technology consists
mainly in exploiting resources, geographically dispersed, to treat complex
applications needing big power of calculation and/or important storage
capacity. However, as resources number increases, the need for scalability,
self-organisation, dynamic reconfigurations, decentralisation and performance
becomes more and more essential. Since such properties are exhibited by P2P
systems, the convergence of grid computing and P2P computing seems natural. In
this context, this paper evaluates the scalability and performance of P2P tools
for discovering and registering services. Three protocols are used for this
purpose: Bonjour, Avahi and Free-Pastry. We have studied the behaviour of
theses protocols related to two criteria: the elapsed time for registrations
services and the needed time to discover new services. Our aim is to analyse
these results in order to choose the best protocol we can use in order to
create a decentralised middleware for desktop grid.

Robust Audio Watermarking Against the D/A and A/D conversions
2007-07-03

Xiang,Shijun
Huang,Jiwu

Audio watermarking has played an important role in multimedia security. In
many applications using audio watermarking, D/A and A/D conversions (denoted by
DA/AD in this paper) are often involved. In previous works, however, the
robustness issue of audio watermarking against the DA/AD conversions has not
drawn sufficient attention yet. In our extensive investigation, it has been
found that the degradation of a watermarked audio signal caused by the DA/AD
conversions manifests itself mainly in terms of wave magnitude distortion and
linear temporal scaling, making the watermark extraction failed. Accordingly, a
DWT-based audio watermarking algorithm robust against the DA/AD conversions is
proposed in this paper. To resist the magnitude distortion, the relative energy
relationships among different groups of the DWT coefficients in the
low-frequency sub-band are utilized in watermark embedding by adaptively
controlling the embedding strength. Furthermore, the resynchronization is
designed to cope with the linear temporal scaling. The time-frequency
localization characteristics of DWT are exploited to save the computational
load in the resynchronization. Consequently, the proposed audio watermarking
algorithm is robust against the DA/AD conversions, other common audio
processing manipulations, and the attacks in StirMark Benchmark for Audio,
which has been verified by experiments.

The $k$-anonymity Problem is Hard

The problem of publishing personal data without giving up privacy is becoming
increasingly important. An interesting formalization recently proposed is the
k-anonymity. This approach requires that the rows in a table are clustered in
sets of size at least k and that all the rows in a cluster become the same
tuple, after the suppression of some records. The natural optimization problem,
where the goal is to minimize the number of suppressed entries, is known to be
NP-hard when the values are over a ternary alphabet, k = 3 and the rows length
is unbounded. In this paper we give a lower bound on the approximation factor
that any polynomial-time algorithm can achive on two restrictions of the
problem,namely (i) when the records values are over a binary alphabet and k =
3, and (ii) when the records have length at most 8 and k = 4, showing that
these restrictions of the problem are APX-hard.

Wei,Shuangqing

Without assuming any knowledge on source's codebook and its output signals,
we formulate a Gaussian jamming problem in block fading channels as a
two-player zero sum game. The outage probability is adopted as an objective
function, over which transmitter aims at minimization and jammer aims at
maximization by selecting their power control strategies. Optimal power control
strategies for each player are obtained under both short-term and long-term
power constraints. For the latter case, we first prove the non-existence of a
Nash equilibrium, and then provide a complete solution for both maxmin and
minimax problems. Numerical results demonstrate a sharp difference between the
outage probabilities of the minimax and maxmin solutions.

Physical Network Coding in Two-Way Wireless Relay Channels
2007-07-03

Popovski,Petar
Yomo,Hiroyuki

It has recently been recognized that the wireless networks represent a
fertile ground for devising communication modes based on network coding. A
particularly suitable application of the network coding arises for the two--way
relay channels, where two nodes communicate with each other assisted by using a
third, relay node. Such a scenario enables application of \emph{physical
network coding}, where the network coding is either done (a) jointly with the
channel coding or (b) through physical combining of the communication flows
over the multiple access channel. In this paper we first group the existing
schemes for physical network coding into two generic schemes, termed 3--step
and 2--step scheme, respectively. We investigate the conditions for
maximization of the two--way rate for each individual scheme: (1) the
Decode--and--Forward (DF) 3--step schemes (2) three different schemes with two
steps: Amplify--and--Forward (AF), JDF and Denoise--and--Forward (DNF). While
the DNF scheme has a potential to offer the best two--way rate, the most
interesting result of the paper is that, for some SNR configurations of the
source--relay links, JDF yields identical maximal two--way rate as the upper
bound on the rate for DNF.

Blind Estimation of Multiple Carrier Frequency Offsets
2007-07-03

Yu,Yuanning
Petropulu,Athina P.
Poor,H. Vincent
Koivunen,Visa

Multiple carrier-frequency offsets (CFO) arise in a distributed antenna
system, where data are transmitted simultaneously from multiple antennas. In
such systems the received signal contains multiple CFOs due to mismatch between
the local oscillators of transmitters and receiver. This results in a
time-varying rotation of the data constellation, which needs to be compensated
for at the receiver before symbol recovery. This paper proposes a new approach
for blind CFO estimation and symbol recovery. The received base-band signal is
over-sampled, and its polyphase components are used to formulate a virtual
Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) problem. By applying blind MIMO system
estimation techniques, the system response is estimated and used to
subsequently transform the multiple CFOs estimation problem into many
independent single CFO estimation problems. Furthermore, an initial estimate of
the CFO is obtained from the phase of the MIMO system response. The Cramer-Rao
Lower bound is also derived, and the large sample performance of the proposed
estimator is compared to the bound.

Fractional Power Control for Decentralized Wireless Networks
2007-07-03
2008-04-28
Jindal,Nihar
Weber,Steven
Andrews,Jeffrey G.

We consider a new approach to power control in decentralized wireless
networks, termed fractional power control (FPC). Transmission power is chosen
as the current channel quality raised to an exponent -s, where s is a constant
between 0 and 1. The choices s = 1 and s = 0 correspond to the familiar cases
of channel inversion and constant power transmission, respectively. Choosing s
in (0,1) allows all intermediate policies between these two extremes to be
evaluated, and we see that usually neither extreme is ideal. We derive
closed-form approximations for the outage probability relative to a target SINR
in a decentralized (ad hoc or unlicensed) network as well as for the resulting
transmission capacity, which is the number of users/m^2 that can achieve this
SINR on average. Using these approximations, which are quite accurate over
typical system parameter values, we prove that using an exponent of 1/2
minimizes the outage probability, meaning that the inverse square root of the
channel strength is a sensible transmit power scaling for networks with a
relatively low density of interferers. We also show numerically that this
choice of s is robust to a wide range of variations in the network parameters.
Intuitively, s=1/2 balances between helping disadvantaged users while making
sure they do not flood the network with interference.

Precoding for the AWGN Channel with Discrete Interference
2007-07-03

Farmanbar,Hamidreza
Khandani,Amir K.

For a state-dependent DMC with input alphabet $\mathcal{X}$ and state
alphabet $\mathcal{S}$ where the i.i.d. state sequence is known causally at the
transmitter, it is shown that by using at most
$|\mathcal{X}||\mathcal{S}|-|\mathcal{S}|+1$ out of
$|\mathcal{X}|^{|\mathcal{S}|}$ input symbols of the Shannon's
\emph{associated} channel, the capacity is achievable. As an example of
state-dependent channels with side information at the transmitter, $M$-ary
signal transmission over AWGN channel with additive $Q$-ary interference where
the sequence of i.i.d. interference symbols is known causally at the
transmitter is considered. For the special case where the Gaussian noise power
is zero, a sufficient condition, which is independent of interference, is given
for the capacity to be $\log_2 M$ bits per channel use. The problem of
maximization of the transmission rate under the constraint that the channel
input given any current interference symbol is uniformly distributed over the
channel input alphabet is investigated. For this setting, the general structure
of a communication system with optimal precoding is proposed.

The Role of Time in the Creation of Knowledge
2007-07-03

Murphy,Roy E.

This paper I assume that in humans the creation of knowledge depends on a
discrete time, or stage, sequential decision-making process subjected to a
stochastic, information transmitting environment. For each time-stage, this
environment randomly transmits Shannon type information-packets to the
decision-maker, who examines each of them for relevancy and then determines his
optimal choices. Using this set of relevant information-packets, the
decision-maker adapts, over time, to the stochastic nature of his environment,
and optimizes the subjective expected rate-of-growth of knowledge. The
decision-maker's optimal actions, lead to a decision function that involves,
over time, his view of the subjective entropy of the environmental process and
other important parameters at each time-stage of the process. Using this model
of human behavior, one could create psychometric experiments using computer
simulation and real decision-makers, to play programmed games to measure the
resulting human performance.

reversible Markov chains, which contribute to the slow convergence of the
algorithms. It has been observed that by overcoming the diffusive behavior of
reversible chains, certain nonreversible chains lifted from reversible ones mix
substantially faster than the original chains. In this paper, we investigate
the idea of accelerating distributed consensus via lifting Markov chains, and
propose a class of Location-Aided Distributed Averaging (LADA) algorithms for
wireless networks, where nodes' coarse location information is used to
construct nonreversible chains that facilitate distributed computing and
cooperative processing. First, two general pseudo-algorithms are presented to
illustrate the notion of distributed averaging through chain-lifting. These
pseudo-algorithms are then respectively instantiated through one LADA algorithm
on grid networks, and one on general wireless networks. For a $k\times k$ grid
network, the proposed LADA algorithm achieves an $\epsilon$-averaging time of
$O(k\log(\epsilon^{-1}))$. Based on this algorithm, in a wireless network with
transmission range $r$, an $\epsilon$-averaging time of
$O(r^{-1}\log(\epsilon^{-1}))$ can be attained through a centralized algorithm.
Subsequently, we present a fully-distributed LADA algorithm for wireless
networks, which utilizes only the direction information of neighbors to
construct nonreversible chains. It is shown that this distributed LADA
algorithm achieves the same scaling law in averaging time as the centralized
scheme. Finally, we propose a cluster-based LADA (C-LADA) algorithm, which,
requiring no central coordination, provides the additional benefit of reduced
message complexity compared with the distributed LADA algorithm.

Phase space methods and psychoacoustic models in lossy transform coding
2007-07-03

Cargo,Matthew Charles

I present a method for lossy transform coding of digital audio that uses the
Weyl symbol calculus for constructing the encoding and decoding transformation.
The method establishes a direct connection between a time-frequency
representation of the signal dependent threshold of masked noise and the
encode/decode pair. The formalism also offers a time-frequency measure of
perceptual entropy.

Weighted Popular Matchings
2007-07-04

Mestre,Julián

We study the problem of assigning jobs to applicants. Each applicant has a
weight and provides a preference list ranking a subset of the jobs. A matching
M is popular if there is no other matching M' such that the weight of the
applicants who prefer M' over M exceeds the weight of those who prefer M over
M'. This paper gives efficient algorithms to find a popular matching if one
exists.

From Royal Road to Epistatic Road for Variable Length Evolution Algorithm
2007-07-04

Platel,Michael Defoin
Verel,Sebastien
Clergue,Manuel
Collard,Philippe

Although there are some real world applications where the use of variable
length representation (VLR) in Evolutionary Algorithm is natural and suitable,
an academic framework is lacking for such representations. In this work we
propose a family of tunable fitness landscapes based on VLR of genotypes. The
fitness landscapes we propose possess a tunable degree of both neutrality and
epistasis; they are inspired, on the one hand by the Royal Road fitness
landscapes, and the other hand by the NK fitness landscapes. So these
landscapes offer a scale of continuity from Royal Road functions, with
neutrality and no epistasis, to landscapes with a large amount of epistasis and
no redundancy. To gain insight into these fitness landscapes, we first use
standard tools such as adaptive walks and correlation length. Second, we
evaluate the performances of evolutionary algorithms on these landscapes for
various values of the neutral and the epistatic parameters; the results allow
us to correlate the performances with the expected degrees of neutrality and
epistasis.

Determinacy in a synchronous pi-calculus

Amadio,Roberto
Dogguy,Mehdi

The S-pi-calculus is a synchronous pi-calculus which is based on the SL
model. The latter is a relaxation of the Esterel model where the reaction to
the absence of a signal within an instant can only happen at the next instant.
In the present work, we present and characterise a compositional semantics of
the S-pi-calculus based on suitable notions of labelled transition system and
bisimulation. Based on this semantic framework, we explore the notion of
determinacy and the related one of (local) confluence.

On a Non-Context-Free Extension of PDL
2007-07-04
2007-07-18
Göller,Stefan
Nowotka,Dirk

Over the last 25 years, a lot of work has been done on seeking for decidable
non-regular extensions of Propositional Dynamic Logic (PDL). Only recently, an
expressive extension of PDL, allowing visibly pushdown automata (VPAs) as a
formalism to describe programs, was introduced and proven to have a
satisfiability problem complete for deterministic double exponential time.
Lately, the VPA formalism was extended to so called k-phase multi-stack visibly
pushdown automata (k-MVPAs). Similarly to VPAs, it has been shown that the
language of k-MVPAs have desirable effective closure properties and that the
emptiness problem is decidable. On the occasion of introducing k-MVPAs, it has
been asked whether the extension of PDL with k-MVPAs still leads to a decidable
logic. This question is answered negatively here. We prove that already for the
extension of PDL with 2-phase MVPAs with two stacks satisfiability becomes
\Sigma_1^1-complete.

Optimal Linear Precoding Strategies for Wideband Non-Cooperative Systems based on Game Theory-Part I: Nash Equilibria
2007-07-04

Scutari,Gesualdo
Palomar,D. P.
Barbarossa,S.

In this two-parts paper we propose a decentralized strategy, based on a
game-theoretic formulation, to find out the optimal precoding/multiplexing
matrices for a multipoint-to-multipoint communication system composed of a set
of wideband links sharing the same physical resources, i.e., time and
bandwidth. We assume, as optimality criterion, the achievement of a Nash
equilibrium and consider two alternative optimization problems: 1) the
competitive maximization of mutual information on each link, given constraints
on the transmit power and on the spectral mask imposed by the radio spectrum
regulatory bodies; and 2) the competitive maximization of the transmission
rate, using finite order constellations, under the same constraints as above,
plus a constraint on the average error probability. In Part I of the paper, we
start by showing that the solution set of both noncooperative games is always
nonempty and contains only pure strategies. Then, we prove that the optimal
precoding/multiplexing scheme for both games leads to a channel diagonalizing
structure, so that both matrix-valued problems can be recast in a simpler
unified vector power control game, with no performance penalty. Thus, we study
this simpler game and derive sufficient conditions ensuring the uniqueness of
the Nash equilibrium. Interestingly, although derived under stronger
constraints, incorporating for example spectral mask constraints, our
uniqueness conditions have broader validity than previously known conditions.
Finally, we assess the goodness of the proposed decentralized strategy by
comparing its performance with the performance of a Pareto-optimal centralized
scheme. To reach the Nash equilibria of the game, in Part II, we propose
alternative distributed algorithms, along with their convergence conditions.

Where are Bottlenecks in NK Fitness Landscapes?
2007-07-04

Verel,Sébastien
Collard,Philippe
Clergue,Manuel

Usually the offspring-parent fitness correlation is used to visualize and
analyze some caracteristics of fitness landscapes such as evolvability. In this
paper, we introduce a more general representation of this correlation, the
Fitness Cloud (FC). We use the bottleneck metaphor to emphasise fitness levels
in landscape that cause local search process to slow down. For a local search
heuristic such as hill-climbing or simulated annealing, FC allows to visualize
bottleneck and neutrality of landscapes. To confirm the relevance of the FC
representation we show where the bottlenecks are in the well-know NK fitness
landscape and also how to use neutrality information from the FC to combine
some neutral operator with local search heuristic.

Scuba Search : when selection meets innovation
2007-07-04

Verel,Sébastien
Collard,Philippe
Clergue,Manuel

We proposed a new search heuristic using the scuba diving metaphor. This
approach is based on the concept of evolvability and tends to exploit
neutrality in fitness landscape. Despite the fact that natural evolution does
not directly select for evolvability, the basic idea behind the scuba search
heuristic is to explicitly push the evolvability to increase. The search
process switches between two phases: Conquest-of-the-Waters and
Invasion-of-the-Land. A comparative study of the new algorithm and standard
local search heuristics on the NKq-landscapes has shown advantage and limit of
the scuba search. To enlighten qualitative differences between neutral search
processes, the space is changed into a connected graph to visualize the
pathways that the search is likely to follow.

Another view of the Gaussian algorithm
2007-07-04

Akhavi,Ali
Moreira,Céline

We introduce here a rewrite system in the group of unimodular matrices,
\emph{i.e.}, matrices with integer entries and with determinant equal to $\pm
1$. We use this rewrite system to precisely characterize the mechanism of the
Gaussian algorithm, that finds shortest vectors in a two--dimensional lattice
given by any basis. Putting together the algorithmic of lattice reduction and
the rewrite system theory, we propose a new worst--case analysis of the
Gaussian algorithm. There is already an optimal worst--case bound for some
variant of the Gaussian algorithm due to Vall\'ee \cite {ValGaussRevisit}. She
used essentially geometric considerations. Our analysis generalizes her result
to the case of the usual Gaussian algorithm. An interesting point in our work
is its possible (but not easy) generalization to the same problem in higher
dimensions, in order to exhibit a tight upper-bound for the number of
iterations of LLL--like reduction algorithms in the worst case. Moreover, our
method seems to work for analyzing other families of algorithms. As an
illustration, the analysis of sorting algorithms are briefly developed in the
last section of the paper.

Dial a Ride from k-forest
2007-07-04

Gupta,Anupam
Hajiaghayi,MohammadTaghi
Nagarajan,Viswanath
Ravi,R.

The k-forest problem is a common generalization of both the k-MST and the
dense-$k$-subgraph problems. Formally, given a metric space on $n$ vertices
$V$, with $m$ demand pairs $\subseteq V \times V$ and a ``target'' $k\le m$,
the goal is to find a minimum cost subgraph that connects at least $k$ demand
pairs. In this paper, we give an $O(\min\{\sqrt{n},\sqrt{k}\})$-approximation
algorithm for $k$-forest, improving on the previous best ratio of
$O(n^{2/3}\log n)$ by Segev & Segev.
  We then apply our algorithm for k-forest to obtain approximation algorithms
for several Dial-a-Ride problems. The basic Dial-a-Ride problem is the
following: given an $n$ point metric space with $m$ objects each with its own
source and destination, and a vehicle capable of carrying at most $k$ objects
at any time, find the minimum length tour that uses this vehicle to move each
object from its source to destination. We prove that an $\alpha$-approximation
algorithm for the $k$-forest problem implies an
$O(\alpha\cdot\log^2n)$-approximation algorithm for Dial-a-Ride. Using our
results for $k$-forest, we get an $O(\min\{\sqrt{n},\sqrt{k}\}\cdot\log^2 n)$-
approximation algorithm for Dial-a-Ride. The only previous result known for
Dial-a-Ride was an $O(\sqrt{k}\log n)$-approximation by Charikar &
Raghavachari; our results give a different proof of a similar approximation
guarantee--in fact, when the vehicle capacity $k$ is large, we give a slight
improvement on their results.

Sphere Lower Bound for Rotated Lattice Constellations in Fading Channels

We study the error probability performance of rotated lattice constellations
in frequency-flat Nakagami-$m$ block-fading channels. In particular, we use the
sphere lower bound on the underlying infinite lattice as a performance
benchmark. We show that the sphere lower bound has full diversity. We observe
that optimally rotated lattices with largest known minimum product distance
perform very close to the lower bound, while the ensemble of random rotations
is shown to lack diversity and perform far from it.

How to use the Scuba Diving metaphor to solve problem with neutrality ?
2007-07-04

Collard,Philippe
Verel,Sébastien
Clergue,Manuel

We proposed a new search heuristic using the scuba diving metaphor. This
approach is based on the concept of evolvability and tends to exploit
neutrality which exists in many real-world problems. Despite the fact that
natural evolution does not directly select for evolvability, the basic idea
behind the scuba search heuristic is to explicitly push evolvability to
increase. A comparative study of the scuba algorithm and standard local search
heuristics has shown the advantage and the limitation of the scuba search. In
order to tune neutrality, we use the NKq fitness landscapes and a family of
travelling salesman problems (TSP) where cities are randomly placed on a
lattice and where travel distance between cities is computed with the Manhattan
metric. In this last problem the amount of neutrality varies with the city
concentration on the grid ; assuming the concentration below one, this TSP
reasonably remains a NP-hard problem.

Clustering and Feature Selection using Sparse Principal Component Analysis
2007-07-04
2008-10-08
Luss,Ronny
d'Aspremont,Alexandre

In this paper, we study the application of sparse principal component
analysis (PCA) to clustering and feature selection problems. Sparse PCA seeks
sparse factors, or linear combinations of the data variables, explaining a
maximum amount of variance in the data while having only a limited number of
nonzero coefficients. PCA is often used as a simple clustering technique and
sparse factors allow us here to interpret the clusters in terms of a reduced
set of variables. We begin with a brief introduction and motivation on sparse
PCA and detail our implementation of the algorithm in d'Aspremont et al.
(2005). We then apply these results to some classic clustering and feature
selection problems arising in biology.

Model Selection Through Sparse Maximum Likelihood Estimation
2007-07-04

Banerjee,Onureena
Ghaoui,Laurent El
d'Aspremont,Alexandre

We consider the problem of estimating the parameters of a Gaussian or binary
distribution in such a way that the resulting undirected graphical model is
sparse. Our approach is to solve a maximum likelihood problem with an added
l_1-norm penalty term. The problem as formulated is convex but the memory
requirements and complexity of existing interior point methods are prohibitive
for problems with more than tens of nodes. We present two new algorithms for
solving problems with at least a thousand nodes in the Gaussian case. Our first
algorithm uses block coordinate descent, and can be interpreted as recursive
l_1-norm penalized regression. Our second algorithm, based on Nesterov's first
order method, yields a complexity estimate with a better dependence on problem
size than existing interior point methods. Using a log determinant relaxation
of the log partition function (Wainwright & Jordan (2006)), we show that these
same algorithms can be used to solve an approximate sparse maximum likelihood
problem for the binary case. We test our algorithms on synthetic data, as well
as on gene expression and senate voting records data.

Optimal Solutions for Sparse Principal Component Analysis

Given a sample covariance matrix, we examine the problem of maximizing the
variance explained by a linear combination of the input variables while
constraining the number of nonzero coefficients in this combination. This is
known as sparse principal component analysis and has a wide array of
applications in machine learning and engineering. We formulate a new
semidefinite relaxation to this problem and derive a greedy algorithm that
computes a full set of good solutions for all target numbers of non zero
coefficients, with total complexity O(n^3), where n is the number of variables.
We then use the same relaxation to derive sufficient conditions for global
optimality of a solution, which can be tested in O(n^3) per pattern. We discuss
applications in subset selection and sparse recovery and show on artificial
examples and biological data that our algorithm does provide globally optimal
solutions in many cases.

The paper addresses geometric aspects of a spatial three-degree-of-freedom
parallel module, which is the parallel module of a hybrid serial-parallel
5-axis machine tool. This parallel module consists of a moving platform that is
connected to a fixed base by three non-identical legs. Each leg is made up of
one prismatic and two pairs of spherical joint, which are connected in a way
that the combined effects of the three legs lead to an over-constrained
mechanism with complex motion. This motion is defined as a simultaneous
combination of rotation and translation. A method for computing the complete
workspace of the VERNE parallel module for various tool lengths is presented.
An algorithm describing this method is also introduced.

Discovery Systems (DS) can be considered as entry points for global loosely
coupled distributed systems. An efficient Discovery System in essence increases
the performance, reliability and decision making capability of distributed
systems. With the rapid increase in scale of distributed applications, existing
solutions for discovery systems are fast becoming either obsolete or incapable
of handling such complexity. They are particularly ineffective when handling
service lifetimes and providing up-to-date information, poor at enabling
dynamic service access and they can also impose unwanted restrictions on
interfaces to widely available information repositories. In this paper we
present essential the design characteristics, an implementation and a
performance analysis for a discovery system capable of overcoming these
deficiencies in large, globally distributed environments.

This paper presents the design and implementation of a Grid-enabled physics
analysis environment for handheld and other resource-limited computing devices
as one example of the use of mobile devices in eScience. Handheld devices offer
great potential because they provide ubiquitous access to data and
round-the-clock connectivity over wireless links. Our solution aims to provide
users of handheld devices the capability to launch heavy computational tasks on
computational and data Grids, monitor the jobs status during execution, and
retrieve results after job completion. Users carry their jobs on their handheld
devices in the form of executables (and associated libraries). Users can
transparently view the status of their jobs and get back their outputs without
having to know where they are being executed. In this way, our system is able
to act as a high-throughput computing environment where devices ranging from
powerful desktop machines to small handhelds can employ the power of the Grid.
The results shown in this paper are readily applicable to the wider eScience
community.

The use of meta-schedulers for resource management in large-scale distributed
systems often leads to a hierarchy of schedulers. In this paper, we discuss why
existing meta-scheduling hierarchies are sometimes not sufficient for Grid
systems due to their inability to re-organise jobs already scheduled locally.
Such a job re-organisation is required to adapt to evolving loads which are
common in heavily used Grid infrastructures. We propose a peer-to-peer
scheduling model and evaluate it using case studies and mathematical modelling.
We detail the DIANA (Data Intensive and Network Aware) scheduling algorithm and
its queue management system for coping with the load distribution and for
supporting bulk job scheduling. We demonstrate that such a system is beneficial
for dynamic, distributed and self-organizing resource management and can assist
in optimizing load or job distribution in complex Grid infrastructures.

Information retrieval from distributed heterogeneous data sources remains a
challenging issue. As the number of data sources increases more intelligent
retrieval techniques, focusing on information content and semantics, are
required. Currently ontologies are being widely used for managing semantic
knowledge, especially in the field of bioinformatics. In this paper we describe
an ontology assisted system that allows users to query distributed
heterogeneous data sources by hiding details like location, information
structure, access pattern and semantic structure of the data. Our goal is to
provide an integrated view on biomedical information sources for the
Health-e-Child project with the aim to overcome the lack of sufficient
semantic-based reformulation techniques for querying distributed data sources.
In particular, this paper examines the problem of query reformulation across
biomedical data sources, based on merged ontologies and the underlying
heterogeneous descriptions of the respective data sources.

Objectives: Grid-based technologies are emerging as potential solutions for
managing and collaborating distributed resources in the biomedical domain. Few
examples exist, however, of successful implementations of Grid-enabled medical
systems and even fewer have been deployed for evaluation in practice. The
objective of this paper is to evaluate the use in clinical practice of a
Grid-based imaging prototype and to establish directions for engineering future
medical Grid developments and their subsequent deployment. Method: The
MammoGrid project has deployed a prototype system for clinicians using the Grid
as its information infrastructure. To assist in the specification of the system
requirements (and for the first time in healthgrid applications), use-case
modelling has been carried out in close collaboration with clinicians and
radiologists who had no prior experience of this modelling technique. A
critical qualitative and, where possible, quantitative analysis of the
MammoGrid prototype is presented leading to a set of recommendations from the
delivery of the first deployed Grid-based medical imaging application. Results:
We report critically on the application of software engineering techniques in
the specification and implementation of the MammoGrid project and show that
use-case modelling is a suitable vehicle for representing medical requirements
and for communicating effectively with the clinical community. This paper also
discusses the practical advantages and limitations of applying the Grid to
real-life clinical applications and presents the consequent lessons learned.

Managing Separation of Concerns in Grid Applications Through Architectural Model Transformations

Grids enable the aggregation, virtualization and sharing of massive
heterogeneous and geographically dispersed resources, using files, applications
and storage devices, to solve computation and data intensive problems, across
institutions and countries via temporary collaborations called virtual
organizations (VO). Most implementations result in complex superposition of
software layers, often delivering low quality of service and quality of
applications. As a consequence, Grid-based applications design and development
is increasingly complex, and the use of most classical engineering practices is
unsuccessful. Not only is the development of such applications a
time-consuming, error prone and expensive task, but also the resulting
applications are often hard-coded for specific Grid configurations, platforms
and infra-structures. Having neither guidelines nor rules in the design of a
Grid-based application is a paradox since there are many existing architectural
approaches for distributed computing, which could ease and promote rigorous
engineering methods based on the re-use of software components. It is our
belief that ad-hoc and semi-formal engineer-ing approaches, in current use, are
insufficient to tackle tomorrows Grid develop-ments requirements. Because
Grid-based applications address multi-disciplinary and complex domains (health,
military, scientific computation), their engineering requires rigor and
control. This paper therefore advocates a formal model-driven engineering
process and corresponding design framework and tools for building the next
generation of Grids.

Grid Computing has made substantial advances in the past decade; these are
primarily due to the adoption of standardized Grid middleware. However Grid
computing has not yet become pervasive because of some barriers that we believe
have been caused by the adoption of middleware centric approaches. These
barriers include: scant support for major types of applications such as
interactive applications; lack of flexible, autonomic and scalable Grid
architectures; lack of plug-and-play Grid computing and, most importantly, no
straightforward way to setup and administer Grids. PhantomOS is a project which
aims to address many of these barriers. Its goal is the creation of a user
friendly pervasive Grid computing platform that facilitates the rapid
deployment and easy maintenance of Grids whilst providing support for major
types of applications on Grids of almost any topology. In this paper we present

Evidence-based medicine is critically dependent on three sources of
information: a medical knowledge base, the patients medical record and
knowledge of available resources, including where appropriate, clinical
protocols. Patient data is often scattered in a variety of databases and may,
in a distributed model, be held across several disparate repositories.
Consequently addressing the needs of an evidence-based medicine community
presents issues of biomedical data integration, clinical interpretation and
knowledge management. This paper outlines how the Health-e-Child project has
approached the challenge of requirements specification for (bio-) medical data
integration, from the level of cellular data, through disease to that of
patient and population. The approach is illuminated through the requirements
elicitation and analysis of Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA), one of three

p-Adic Degeneracy of the Genetic Code

Degeneracy of the genetic code is a biological way to minimize effects of the
undesirable mutation changes. Degeneration has a natural description on the
5-adic space of 64 codons $\mathcal{C}_5 (64) = \{n_0 + n_1 5 + n_2 5^2
  : n_i = 1, 2, 3, 4 \} ,$ where $n_i$ are digits related to nucleotides as
follows: C = 1, A = 2, T = U = 3, G = 4. The smallest 5-adic distance between
codons joins them into 16 quadruplets, which under 2-adic distance decay into
32 doublets. p-Adically close codons are assigned to one of 20 amino acids,
which are building blocks of proteins, or code termination of protein
synthesis. We shown that genetic code multiplets are made of the p-adic nearest
codons.

Performance of Linear Field Reconstruction Techniques with Noise and Uncertain Sensor Locations
2007-07-05

Nordio,A.
Chiasserini,C. -F.
Viterbo,E.

We consider a wireless sensor network, sampling a bandlimited field,
described by a limited number of harmonics. Sensor nodes are irregularly
deployed over the area of interest or subject to random motion; in addition
sensors measurements are affected by noise. Our goal is to obtain a high
quality reconstruction of the field, with the mean square error (MSE) of the
estimate as performance metric. In particular, we analytically derive the
performance of several reconstruction/estimation techniques based on linear
filtering. For each technique, we obtain the MSE, as well as its asymptotic
expression in the case where the field number of harmonics and the number of
sensors grow to infinity, while their ratio is kept constant. Through numerical
simulations, we show the validity of the asymptotic analysis, even for a small
number of sensors. We provide some novel guidelines for the design of sensor
networks when many parameters, such as field bandwidth, number of sensors,
reconstruction quality, sensor motion characteristics, and noise level of the
measures, have to be traded off.

A New Family of Unitary Space-Time Codes with a Fast Parallel Sphere Decoder Algorithm
2007-07-05

Chen,Xinjia
Zhou,Kemin
Aravena,Jorge

In this paper we propose a new design criterion and a new class of unitary
signal constellations for differential space-time modulation for
multiple-antenna systems over Rayleigh flat-fading channels with unknown fading
coefficients. Extensive simulations show that the new codes have significantly
better performance than existing codes. We have compared the performance of our
codes with differential detection schemes using orthogonal design, Cayley
differential codes, fixed-point-free group codes and product of groups and for
the same bit error rate, our codes allow smaller signal to noise ratio by as
much as 10 dB. The design of the new codes is accomplished in a systematic way
through the optimization of a performance index that closely describes the bit
error rate as a function of the signal to noise ratio. The new performance
index is computationally simple and we have derived analytical expressions for
its gradient with respect to constellation parameters. Decoding of the proposed
constellations is reduced to a set of one-dimensional closest point problems
that we solve using parallel sphere decoder algorithms. This decoding strategy
can also improve efficiency of existing codes.

Reversible contrast mapping (RCM) is a simple integer transform that applies
to pairs of pixels. For some pairs of pixels, RCM is invertible, even if the
least significant bits (LSBs) of the transformed pixels are lost. The data
space occupied by the LSBs is suitable for data hiding. The embedded
information bit-rates of the proposed spatial domain reversible watermarking
scheme are close to the highest bit-rates reported so far. The scheme does not
need additional data compression, and, in terms of mathematical complexity, it
appears to be the lowest complexity one proposed up to now. A very fast lookup
table implementation is proposed. Robustness against cropping can be ensured as
well.

On the Minimum Number of Transmissions in Single-Hop Wireless Coding Networks
2007-07-05

Rouayheb,Salim Y. El
Chaudhry,Mohammad Asad R.
Sprintson,Alex

The advent of network coding presents promising opportunities in many areas
of communication and networking. It has been recently shown that network coding
technique can significantly increase the overall throughput of wireless
networks by taking advantage of their broadcast nature. In wireless networks,
each transmitted packet is broadcasted within a certain area and can be
overheard by the neighboring nodes. When a node needs to transmit packets, it
employs the opportunistic coding approach that uses the knowledge of what the
node's neighbors have heard in order to reduce the number of transmissions.
With this approach, each transmitted packet is a linear combination of the
original packets over a certain finite field.
  In this paper, we focus on the fundamental problem of finding the optimal
encoding for the broadcasted packets that minimizes the overall number of
transmissions. We show that this problem is NP-complete over GF(2) and
establish several fundamental properties of the optimal solution. We also
propose a simple heuristic solution for the problem based on graph coloring and
present some empirical results for random settings.

Scheduling in Data Intensive and Network Aware (DIANA) Grid Environments
2007-07-05

McClatchey,Richard
Anjum,Ashiq
Stockinger,Heinz
Ali,Arshad
Willers,Ian
Thomas,Michael

In Grids scheduling decisions are often made on the basis of jobs being
either data or computation intensive: in data intensive situations jobs may be
pushed to the data and in computation intensive situations data may be pulled
to the jobs. This kind of scheduling, in which there is no consideration of
network characteristics, can lead to performance degradation in a Grid
environment and may result in large processing queues and job execution delays
due to site overloads. In this paper we describe a Data Intensive and Network
Aware (DIANA) meta-scheduling approach, which takes into account data,
processing power and network characteristics when making scheduling decisions
across multiple sites. Through a practical implementation on a Grid testbed, we
demonstrate that queue and execution times of data-intensive jobs can be
significantly improved when we introduce our proposed DIANA scheduler. The
basic scheduling decisions are dictated by a weighting factor for each
potential target location which is a calculated function of network
characteristics, processing cycles and data location and size. The job
scheduler provides a global ranking of the computing resources and then selects
an optimal one on the basis of this overall access and execution cost. The
DIANA approach considers the Grid as a combination of active network elements
and takes network characteristics as a first class criterion in the scheduling
decision matrix along with computation and data. The scheduler can then make
informed decisions by taking into account the changing state of the network,
locality and size of the data and the pool of available processing cycles.

Optimal Linear Precoding Strategies for Wideband Non-Cooperative Systems based on Game Theory-Part II: Algorithms
2007-07-05

Scutari,Gesualdo
Palomar,Daniel P.
Barbarossa,Sergio

In this two-part paper, we address the problem of finding the optimal
precoding/multiplexing scheme for a set of non-cooperative links sharing the
same physical resources, e.g., time and bandwidth. We consider two alternative
optimization problems: P.1) the maximization of mutual information on each
link, given constraints on the transmit power and spectral mask; and P.2) the
maximization of the transmission rate on each link, using finite order
constellations, under the same constraints as in P.1, plus a constraint on the
maximum average error probability on each link. Aiming at finding decentralized
strategies, we adopted as optimality criterion the achievement of a Nash
equilibrium and thus we formulated both problems P.1 and P.2 as strategic
noncooperative (matrix-valued) games. In Part I of this two-part paper, after
deriving the optimal structure of the linear transceivers for both games, we
provided a unified set of sufficient conditions that guarantee the uniqueness
of the Nash equilibrium. In this Part II, we focus on the achievement of the
equilibrium and propose alternative distributed iterative algorithms that solve
both games. Specifically, the new proposed algorithms are the following: 1) the
sequential and simultaneous iterative waterfilling based algorithms,
incorporating spectral mask constraints; 2) the sequential and simultaneous
gradient projection based algorithms, establishing an interesting link with
variational inequality problems. Our main contribution is to provide sufficient
conditions for the global convergence of all the proposed algorithms which,
although derived under stronger constraints, incorporating for example spectral
mask constraints, have a broader validity than the convergence conditions known
in the current literature for the sequential iterative waterfilling algorithm.

Risk Analysis in Robust Control -- Making the Case for Probabilistic Robust Control
2007-07-05

Chen,Xinjia
Aravena,Jorge
Zhou,Kemin

This paper offers a critical view of the "worst-case" approach that is the
cornerstone of robust control design. It is our contention that a blind
acceptance of worst-case scenarios may lead to designs that are actually more
dangerous than designs based on probabilistic techniques with a built-in risk
factor. The real issue is one of modeling. If one accepts that no mathematical
model of uncertainties is perfect then a probabilistic approach can lead to
more reliable control even if it cannot guarantee stability for all possible
cases. Our presentation is based on case analysis. We first establish that
worst-case is not necessarily "all-encompassing." In fact, we show that for
some uncertain control problems to have a conventional robust control solution
it is necessary to make assumptions that leave out some feasible cases. Once we
establish that point, we argue that it is not uncommon for the risk of
unaccounted cases in worst-case design to be greater than that of the accepted
risk in a probabilistic approach. With an example, we quantify the risks and
show that worst-case can be significantly more risky. Finally, we join our
analysis with existing results on computational complexity and probabilistic
robustness to argue that the deterministic worst-case analysis is not
necessarily the better tool.

Are there Hilbert-style Pure Type Systems?
2007-07-05
2008-01-07
Bunder,M. W.
Dekkers,W. M. J.

For many a natural deduction style logic there is a Hilbert-style logic that
is equivalent to it in that it has the same theorems (i.e. valid judgements
with empty contexts). For intuitionistic logic, the axioms of the equivalent
Hilbert-style logic can be propositions which are also known as the types of
the combinators I, K and S. Hilbert-style versions of illative combinatory
logic have formulations with axioms that are actual type statements for I, K
and S. As pure type systems (PTSs)are, in a sense, equivalent to systems of
illative combinatory logic, it might be thought that Hilbert-style PTSs (HPTSs)
could be based in a similar way. This paper shows that some PTSs have very
trivial equivalent HPTSs, with only the axioms as theorems and that for many
PTSs no equivalent HPTS can exist. Most commonly used PTSs belong to these two
classes. For some PTSs however, including lambda* and the PTS at the basis of
the proof assistant Coq, there is a nontrivial equivalent HPTS, with axioms
that are type statements for I, K and S.

The Nash Equilibrium Revisited: Chaos and Complexity Hidden in Simplicity
2007-07-05

Fellman,Philip V.

The Nash Equilibrium is a much discussed, deceptively complex, method for the
analysis of non-cooperative games. If one reads many of the commonly available
definitions the description of the Nash Equilibrium is deceptively simple in
appearance. Modern research has discovered a number of new and important
complex properties of the Nash Equilibrium, some of which remain as
contemporary conundrums of extraordinary difficulty and complexity. Among the
recently discovered features which the Nash Equilibrium exhibits under various
conditions are heteroclinic Hamiltonian dynamics, a very complex asymptotic
structure in the context of two-player bi-matrix games and a number of
computationally complex or computationally intractable features in other
settings. This paper reviews those findings and then suggests how they may
inform various market prediction strategies.

Segmentation and Context of Literary and Musical Sequences
2007-07-05

Zanette,Damian H.

We test a segmentation algorithm, based on the calculation of the
Jensen-Shannon divergence between probability distributions, to two symbolic
sequences of literary and musical origin. The first sequence represents the
successive appearance of characters in a theatrical play, and the second
represents the succession of tones from the twelve-tone scale in a keyboard
sonata. The algorithm divides the sequences into segments of maximal
compositional divergence between them. For the play, these segments are related
to changes in the frequency of appearance of different characters and in the
geographical setting of the action. For the sonata, the segments correspond to
tonal domains and reveal in detail the characteristic tonal progression of such
kind of musical composition.

Spectrum Sensing in Cognitive Radios Based on Multiple Cyclic Frequencies
2007-07-06

Lundén,Jarmo
Koivunen,Visa
Huttunen,Anu
Poor,H. Vincent

Cognitive radios sense the radio spectrum in order to find unused frequency
bands and use them in an agile manner. Transmission by the primary user must be
detected reliably even in the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime and in the
face of shadowing and fading. Communication signals are typically
cyclostationary, and have many periodic statistical properties related to the
symbol rate, the coding and modulation schemes as well as the guard periods,
for example. These properties can be exploited in designing a detector, and for
distinguishing between the primary and secondary users' signals. In this paper,
a generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) for detecting the presence of
cyclostationarity using multiple cyclic frequencies is proposed. Distributed
decision making is employed by combining the quantized local test statistics
from many secondary users. User cooperation allows for mitigating the effects
of shadowing and provides a larger footprint for the cognitive radio system.
Simulation examples demonstrate the resulting performance gains in the low SNR
regime and the benefits of cooperative detection.

Descriptions as recursive functions are also provided whenever suitable, thus
yielding a a verification condition generator and a static analyser that can be

Resource Allocation for Wireless Fading Relay Channels: Max-Min Solution
2007-07-06

Liang,Yingbin
Veeravalli,Venugopal V.
Poor,H. Vincent

As a basic information-theoretic model for fading relay channels, the
parallel relay channel is first studied, for which lower and upper bounds on
the capacity are derived. For the parallel relay channel with degraded
subchannels, the capacity is established, and is further demonstrated via the
Gaussian case, for which the synchronized and asynchronized capacities are
obtained. The capacity achieving power allocation at the source and relay nodes
among the subchannels is characterized. The fading relay channel is then
studied, for which resource allocations that maximize the achievable rates are
obtained for both the full-duplex and half-duplex cases. Capacities are
established for fading relay channels that satisfy certain conditions.

When Network Coding and Dirty Paper Coding meet in a Cooperative Ad Hoc Network

Debbah,Merouane

We develop and analyze new cooperative strategies for ad hoc networks that
are more spectrally efficient than classical DF cooperative protocols. Using
analog network coding, our strategies preserve the practical half-duplex
assumption but relax the orthogonality constraint. The introduction of
interference due to non-orthogonality is mitigated thanks to precoding, in
particular Dirty Paper coding. Combined with smart power allocation, our
cooperation strategies allow to save time and lead to more efficient use of
bandwidth and to improved network throughput with respect to classical RDF/PDF.

On Cognitive Interference Networks
2007-07-06

Lapidoth,Amos
Shamai,Shlomo
Wigger,Michele A.

We study the high-power asymptotic behavior of the sum-rate capacity of
multi-user interference networks with an equal number of transmitters and
receivers. We assume that each transmitter is cognizant of the message it
wishes to convey to its corresponding receiver and also of the messages that a
subset of the other transmitters wish to send. The receivers are assumed not to
be able to cooperate in any way so that they must base their decision on the
signal they receive only. We focus on the network's pre-log, which is defined
as the limiting ratio of the sum-rate capacity to half the logarithm of the
transmitted power. We present both upper and lower bounds on the network's
pre-log. The lower bounds are based on a linear partial-cancellation scheme
which entails linearly transforming Gaussian codebooks so as to eliminate the
interference in a subset of the receivers. Inter alias, the bounds give a
complete characterization of the networks and side-information settings that
result in a full pre-log, i.e., in a pre-log that is equal to the number of
transmitters (and receivers) as well as a complete characterization of networks
whose pre-log is equal to the full pre-log minus one. They also fully
characterize networks where the full pre-log can only be achieved if each
transmitter knows the messages of all users, i.e., when the side-information is
"full".

Noisy Sorting Without Resampling
2007-07-06

Braverman,Mark
Mossel,Elchanan

In this paper we study noisy sorting without re-sampling. In this problem
there is an unknown order $a_{\pi(1)} < ... < a_{\pi(n)}$ where $\pi$ is a
permutation on $n$ elements. The input is the status of $n \choose 2$ queries
of the form $q(a_i,x_j)$, where $q(a_i,a_j) = +$ with probability at least
$1/2+\ga$ if $\pi(i) > \pi(j)$ for all pairs $i \neq j$, where $\ga > 0$ is a
constant and $q(a_i,a_j) = -q(a_j,a_i)$ for all $i$ and $j$. It is assumed that
the errors are independent. Given the status of the queries the goal is to find
the maximum likelihood order. In other words, the goal is find a permutation
$\sigma$ that minimizes the number of pairs $\sigma(i) > \sigma(j)$ where
$q(\sigma(i),\sigma(j)) = -$. The problem so defined is the feedback arc set
problem on distributions of inputs, each of which is a tournament obtained as a
noisy perturbations of a linear order. Note that when $\ga < 1/2$ and $n$ is
large, it is impossible to recover the original order $\pi$.
  It is known that the weighted feedback are set problem on tournaments is
NP-hard in general. Here we present an algorithm of running time
$n^{O(\gamma^{-4})}$ and sampling complexity $O_{\gamma}(n \log n)$ that with
high probability solves the noisy sorting without re-sampling problem. We also
show that if $a_{\sigma(1)},a_{\sigma(2)},...,a_{\sigma(n)}$ is an optimal
solution of the problem then it is ``close'' to the original order. More
formally, with high probability it holds that $\sum_i |\sigma(i) - \pi(i)| =
\Theta(n)$ and $\max_i |\sigma(i) - \pi(i)| = \Theta(\log n)$.
  Our results are of interest in applications to ranking, such as ranking in
sports, or ranking of search items based on comparisons by experts.

Exploration via design and the cost of uncertainty in keyword auctions
2007-07-06

Singh,Sudhir Kumar
Roychowdhury,Vwani P.
Bradonjić,Milan
Rezaei,Behnam A.

We present a deterministic exploration mechanism for sponsored search
auctions, which enables the auctioneer to learn the relevance scores of
advertisers, and allows advertisers to estimate the true value of clicks
generated at the auction site. This exploratory mechanism deviates only
minimally from the mechanism being currently used by Google and Yahoo! in the
sense that it retains the same pricing rule, similar ranking scheme, as well
as, similar mathematical structure of payoffs. In particular, the estimations
of the relevance scores and true-values are achieved by providing a chance to
lower ranked advertisers to obtain better slots. This allows the search engine
to potentially test a new pool of advertisers, and correspondingly, enables new
advertisers to estimate the value of clicks/leads generated via the auction.
Both these quantities are unknown a priori, and their knowledge is necessary
for the auction to operate efficiently. We show that such an exploration policy
can be incorporated without any significant loss in revenue for the auctioneer.
We compare the revenue of the new mechanism to that of the standard mechanism
at their corresponding symmetric Nash equilibria and compute the cost of
uncertainty, which is defined as the relative loss in expected revenue per
impression. We also bound the loss in efficiency, as well as, in user
experience due to exploration, under the same solution concept (i.e. SNE). Thus
the proposed exploration mechanism learns the relevance scores while
incorporating the incentive constraints from the advertisers who are selfish
and are trying to maximize their own profits, and therefore, the exploration is
essentially achieved via mechanism design. We also discuss variations of the
new mechanism such as truthful implementations.

For-profit mediators in sponsored search advertising

Singh,Sudhir Kumar

Gunadhi,Himawan
Rezaei,Behnam A.

A mediator is a well-known construct in game theory, and is an entity that
plays on behalf of some of the agents who choose to use its services, while the
rest of the agents participate in the game directly. We initiate a game
theoretic study of sponsored search auctions, such as those used by Google and
Yahoo!, involving {\em incentive driven} mediators. We refer to such mediators
as {\em for-profit} mediators, so as to distinguish them from mediators
introduced in prior work, who have no monetary incentives, and are driven by
the altruistic goal of implementing certain desired outcomes. We show that in
our model, (i) players/advertisers can improve their payoffs by choosing to use
the services of the mediator, compared to directly participating in the
auction; (ii) the mediator can obtain monetary benefit by managing the
advertising burden of its group of advertisers; and (iii) the payoffs of the
mediator and the advertisers it plays for are compatible with the incentive
constraints from the advertisers who do dot use its services. A simple
intuition behind the above result comes from the observation that the mediator
has more information about and more control over the bid profile than any
individual advertiser, allowing her to reduce the payments made to the
auctioneer, while still maintaining incentive constraints. Further, our results
indicate that there are significant opportunities for diversification in the
internet economy and we should expect it to continue to develop richer
structure, with room for different types of agents to coexist.

High-resolution distributed sampling of bandlimited fields with low-precision sensors
2007-07-09
2008-12-10
Kumar,Animesh
Ishwar,Prakash
Ramchandran,Kannan

The problem of sampling a discrete-time sequence of spatially bandlimited
fields with a bounded dynamic range, in a distributed,
communication-constrained, processing environment is addressed. A central unit,
having access to the data gathered by a dense network of fixed-precision
sensors, operating under stringent inter-node communication constraints, is
required to reconstruct the field snapshots to maximum accuracy. Both
deterministic and stochastic field models are considered. For stochastic
fields, results are established in the almost-sure sense. The feasibility of
having a flexible tradeoff between the oversampling rate (sensor density) and
the analog-to-digital converter (ADC) precision, while achieving an exponential
accuracy in the number of bits per Nyquist-interval per snapshot is
demonstrated. This exposes an underlying ``conservation of bits'' principle:
the bit-budget per Nyquist-interval per snapshot (the rate) can be distributed
along the amplitude axis (sensor-precision) and space (sensor density) in an
almost arbitrary discrete-valued manner, while retaining the same (exponential)
distortion-rate characteristics. Achievable information scaling laws for field
reconstruction over a bounded region are also derived: With N one-bit sensors
per Nyquist-interval, $\Theta(\log N)$ Nyquist-intervals, and total network
bitrate $R_{net} = \Theta((\log N)^2)$ (per-sensor bitrate $\Theta((\log
N)/N)$), the maximum pointwise distortion goes to zero as $D = O((\log N)^2/N)$
or $D = O(R_{net} 2^{-\beta \sqrt{R_{net}}})$. This is shown to be possible
with only nearest-neighbor communication, distributed coding, and appropriate
interpolation algorithms. For a fixed, nonzero target distortion, the number of
fixed-precision sensors and the network rate needed is always finite.

The Effect of Noise Correlation in AF Relay Networks
2007-07-07

Gomadam,Krishna S.
Jafar,Syed A.

In wireless relay networks, noise at the relays can be correlated possibly
due to common interference or noise propagation from preceding hops. In this
work we consider a parallel relay network with noise correlation. For the relay
strategy of amplify-and-forward (AF), we determine the optimal rate maximizing
relay gains when correlation knowledge is available at the relays. The effect
of correlation on the performance of the relay networks is analyzed for the
cases where full knowledge of correlation is available at the relays and when
there is no knowledge about the correlation structure. Interestingly we find
that, on the average, noise correlation is beneficial regardless of whether the
relays know the noise covariance matrix or not. However, the knowledge of
correlation can greatly improve the performance. Typically, the performance
improvement from correlation knowledge increases with the relay power and the
number of relays. With perfect correlation knowledge the system is capable of
canceling interference if the number of interferers is less than the number of
relays.
  For a dual-hop multiple access parallel network, we obtain closed form
expressions for the maximum sum-rate and the optimal relay strategy. The relay
optimization for networks with three hops is also considered. For any relay
gains for the first stage relays, this represents a parallel relay network with
correlated noise. Based on the result of two hop networks with noise
correlation, we propose an algorithm for solving the relay optimization problem
for three-hop networks.

Delayed Correlations in Inter-Domain Network Traffic
2007-07-07

Rojkova,Viktoria
Kantardzic,Mehmed

To observe the evolution of network traffic correlations we analyze the
eigenvalue spectra and eigenvectors statistics of delayed correlation matrices
of network traffic counts time series. Delayed correlation matrix D is composed
of the correlations between one variable in the multivariable time series and
another at a time delay \tau . Inverse participation ratio (IPR) of
eigenvectors of D deviates substantially from the IPR of eigenvectors of the
equal time correlation matrix C. We relate this finding to the localization and
discuss its importance for network congestion control. The time-lagged
correlation pattern between network time series is preserved over a long time,
up to 100\tau, where \tau=300 sec. The largest eigenvalue \lambda_{max} of D
and the corresponding IPR oscillate with two characteristic periods of 3\tau
and 6\tau . The existence of delayed correlations between network time series
fits well into the long range dependence (LRD) property of the network traffic.
  The ability to monitor and control the long memory processes is crucial since
they impact the network performance. Injecting the random traffic counts
between non-randomly correlated time series, we were able to break the picture
of periodicity of \lambda_{max}. In addition, we investigated influence of the
periodic injections on both largest eigenvalue and the IPR, and addressed
relevance of these indicators for the LRD and self-similarity of the network
traffic.

Better Algorithms and Bounds for Directed Maximum Leaf Problems

The {\sc Directed Maximum Leaf Out-Branching} problem is to find an

the maximum number of leaves. In this paper, we improve known parameterized
algorithms and combinatorial bounds on the number of leaves in out-branchings.
We show that
  \begin{itemize} \item every strongly connected digraph $D$ of order $n$ with
minimum in-degree at least 3 has an out-branching with at least $(n/4)^{1/3}-1$
leaves; \item if a strongly connected digraph $D$ does not contain an
out-branching with $k$ leaves, then the pathwidth of its underlying graph is
$O(k\log k)$; \item it can be decided in time $2^{O(k\log^2 k)}\cdot n^{O(1)}$
whether a strongly connected digraph on $n$ vertices has an out-branching with
at least $k$ leaves. \end{itemize}
  All improvements use properties of extremal structures obtained after
applying local search and of some out-branching decompositions.

Worst-Case Interactive Communication and Enhancing Sensor Network Lifetime

Agnihotri,Samar

We are concerned with the problem of maximizing the worst-case lifetime of a
data-gathering wireless sensor network consisting of a set of sensor nodes
directly communicating with a base-station.We propose to solve this problem by
modeling sensor node and base-station communication as the interactive
communication between multiple correlated informants (sensor nodes) and a
recipient (base-station). We provide practical and scalable interactive
communication protocols for data gathering in sensor networks and demonstrate
their efficiency compared to traditional approaches.
  In this paper, we first develop a formalism to address the problem of
worst-case interactive communication between a set of multiple correlated
informants and a recipient. We realize that there can be different objectives
to achieve in such a communication scenario and compute the optimal number of
messages and bits exchanged to realize these objectives. Then, we propose to
adapt these results in the context of single-hop data-gathering sensor
networks. Finally, based on this proposed formalism, we propose a clustering
based communication protocol for large sensor networks and demonstrate its
superiority over a traditional clustering protocol.

Logic, Design & Organization of PTVD-SHAM; A Parallel Time Varying & Data Super-helical Access Memory

Alipour,P. B.

This paper encompasses a super helical memory system's design, 'Boolean logic
& image-logic' as a theoretical concept of an invention-model to 'store
time-data' in terms of anticipating the best memory location ever for
data/time. A waterfall effect is deemed to assist the process of
potential-difference output-switch into diverse logic states in quantum dot
computational methods via utilizing coiled carbon nanotubes (CCNTs) and carbon
nanotube field effect transistors (CNFETs). A 'quantum confinement' is thus
derived for a flow of particles in a categorized quantum well substrate with a
normalized capacitance rectifying high B-field flux into electromagnetic
induction. Multi-access of coherent sequences of 'qubit addressing' is gained
in any magnitude as pre-defined for the orientation of array displacement.
Briefly, Gaussian curvature of k<0 is debated in aim of specifying the 2D
electron gas characteristics in scenarios where data is stored in short
intervals versus long ones e.g. when k'>(k<0) for greater CCNT diameters,
space-time continuum is folded by chance for the particle. This benefits from
Maxwell-Lorentz theory in Minkowski's space-time viewpoint alike to crystal
oscillators for precise data timing purposes and radar systems e.g., time
varying self-clocking devices in diverse geographic locations. This application
could also be optional for data depository versus extraction, in the best
supercomputer system's locations, autonomously. For best performance in
minimizing current limiting mechanisms including electromigration, a multilevel
metallization and implant process forming elevated sources/drains for the
circuit's staircase pyramidal construction, is discussed accordingly.

Solvability of a Polynomial Equation with a constant number of variables,
within a bounded real space. We first introduce four new Theorems for a set of
periodic Functions with irrational periods, based on which we then use a
trigonometric substitution, to show how the HCP can be expressed as the
Solvability of a single polynomial Equation with a constant number of
variables. The feasible solution of each of these variables is bounded within
two real numbers. We point out what future work is necessary to prove that
P=NP.

Singular curves and cusp points in the joint space of 3-RPR parallel manipulators
2007-07-09

Zein,Mazen
Wenger,Philippe
Chablat,Damien

This paper investigates the singular curves in two-dimensional slices of the
joint space of a family of planar parallel manipulators. It focuses on special
points, referred to as cusp points, which may appear on these curves. Cusp
points play an important role in the kinematic behavior of parallel
manipulators since they make possible a nonsingular change of assembly mode.
The purpose of this study is twofold. First, it reviews an important previous
work, which, to the authors' knowledge, has never been exploited yet. Second,
it determines the cusp points in any two-dimensional slice of the joint space.
First results show that the number of cusp points may vary from zero to eight.
This work finds applications in both design and trajectory planning.

Graph-Based Decoding in the Presence of ISI
2007-07-09

Taghavi,Mohammad H.
Siegel,Paul H.

We propose an approximation of maximum-likelihood detection in ISI channels
based on linear programming or message passing. We convert the detection
problem into a binary decoding problem, which can be easily combined with LDPC
decoding. We show that, for a certain class of channels and in the absence of
coding, the proposed technique provides the exact ML solution without an
exponential complexity in the size of channel memory, while for some other
channels, this method has a non-diminishing probability of failure as SNR
increases. Some analysis is provided for the error events of the proposed
technique under linear programming.

Building Decision Procedures in the Calculus of Inductive Constructions
2007-07-09

Blanqui,Frédéric
Jouannaud,Jean-Pierre
Strub,Pierre-Yves

It is commonly agreed that the success of future proof assistants will rely
on their ability to incorporate computations within deduction in order to mimic
the mathematician when replacing the proof of a proposition P by the proof of
an equivalent proposition P' obtained from P thanks to possibly complex
calculations. In this paper, we investigate a new version of the calculus of
inductive constructions which incorporates arbitrary decision procedures into
deduction via the conversion rule of the calculus. The novelty of the problem
in the context of the calculus of inductive constructions lies in the fact that
the computation mechanism varies along proof-checking: goals are sent to the
decision procedure together with the set of user hypotheses available from the
current context. Our main result shows that this extension of the calculus of
constructions does not compromise its main properties: confluence, subject
reduction, strong normalization and consistency are all preserved.

Espaces de repr\'esentation multidimensionnels d\'edi\'es \`a la visualisation

Messaoud,Riadh Ben
Aouiche,Kamel
Favre,Cécile

In decision-support systems, the visual component is important for On Line
Analysis Processing (OLAP). In this paper, we propose a new approach that faces
the visualization problem due to data sparsity. We use the results of a
Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA) to reduce the negative effect of
sparsity by organizing differently data cube cells. Our approach does not
reduce sparsity, however it tries to build relevant representation spaces where
facts are efficiently gathered. In order to evaluate our approach, we propose
an homogeneity criterion based on geometric neighborhood of cells. The obtained
experimental results have shown the efficiency of our method.

Efficient supervised learning in networks with binary synapses
2007-07-09

Baldassi,Carlo
Braunstein,Alfredo
Brunel,Nicolas
Zecchina,Riccardo

Recent experimental studies indicate that synaptic changes induced by
neuronal activity are discrete jumps between a small number of stable states.
Learning in systems with discrete synapses is known to be a computationally
hard problem. Here, we study a neurobiologically plausible on-line learning
algorithm that derives from Belief Propagation algorithms. We show that it
performs remarkably well in a model neuron with binary synapses, and a finite
number of `hidden' states per synapse, that has to learn a random
classification task. Such system is able to learn a number of associations
close to the theoretical limit, in time which is sublinear in system size. This
is to our knowledge the first on-line algorithm that is able to achieve
efficiently a finite number of patterns learned per binary synapse.
Furthermore, we show that performance is optimal for a finite number of hidden
states which becomes very small for sparse coding. The algorithm is similar to
the standard `perceptron' learning algorithm, with an additional rule for
synaptic transitions which occur only if a currently presented pattern is
`barely correct'. In this case, the synaptic changes are meta-plastic only
(change in hidden states and not in actual synaptic state), stabilizing the
synapse in its current state. Finally, we show that a system with two visible
states and K hidden states is much more robust to noise than a system with K
visible states. We suggest this rule is sufficiently simple to be easily
implemented by neurobiological systems or in hardware.

XML data warehouses form an interesting basis for decision-support

results demonstrate the efficiency of our index, even when queries are complex.

Indices and materialized views are physical structures that accelerate data
access in data warehouses. However, these data structures generate some
maintenance overhead. They also share the same storage space. The existing
studies about index and materialized view selection consider these structures
separately. In this paper, we adopt the opposite stance and couple index and
materialized view selection to take into account the interactions between them
and achieve an efficient storage space sharing. We develop cost models that
evaluate the respective benefit of indexing and view materialization. These
cost models are then exploited by a greedy algorithm to select a relevant
configuration of indices and materialized views. Experimental results show that
our strategy performs better than the independent selection of indices and
materialized views.

Computability Closure: Ten Years Later
2007-07-10

Blanqui,Frédéric

The notion of computability closure has been introduced for proving the
termination of higher-order rewriting with first-order matching by Jean-Pierre
Jouannaud and Mitsuhiro Okada in a 1997 draft which later served as a basis for
the author's PhD. In this paper, we show how this notion can also be used for
dealing with beta-normalized rewriting with matching modulo beta-eta (on
patterns \`a la Miller), rewriting with matching modulo some equational theory,
and higher-order data types (types with constructors having functional
recursive arguments). Finally, we show how the computability closure can easily
be turned into a reduction ordering which, in the higher-order case, contains
Jean-Pierre Jouannaud and Albert Rubio's higher-order recursive path ordering
and, in the first-order case, is equal to the usual first-order recursive path
ordering.

Sequential products in effect categories

A new categorical framework is provided for dealing with multiple arguments
in a programming language with effects, for example in a language with
imperative features. Like related frameworks (Monads, Arrows, Freyd
categories), we distinguish two kinds of functions. In addition, we also
distinguish two kinds of equations. Then, we are able to define a kind of
product, that generalizes the usual categorical product. This yields a powerful
tool for deriving many results about languages with effects.

Clusters, Graphs, and Networks for Analysing Internet-Web-Supported Communication within a Virtual Community
2007-07-10

Polanco,Xavier

The proposal is to use clusters, graphs and networks as models in order to
analyse the Web structure. Clusters, graphs and networks provide knowledge
representation and organization. Clusters were generated by co-site analysis.
The sample is a set of academic Web sites from the countries belonging to the
European Union. These clusters are here revisited from the point of view of
graph theory and social network analysis. This is a quantitative and structural
analysis. In fact, the Internet is a computer network that connects people and
organizations. Thus we may consider it to be a social network. The set of Web
academic sites represents an empirical social network, and is viewed as a
virtual community. The network structural properties are here analysed applying
together cluster analysis, graph theory and social network analysis.

Secrecy Capacity Region of Fading Broadcast Channels
2007-07-10

Liang,Yingbin
Poor,H. Vincent
Shamai,Shlomo

The fading broadcast channel with confidential messages (BCC) is
investigated, where a source node has common information for two receivers
(receivers 1 and 2), and has confidential information intended only for
receiver 1. The confidential information needs to be kept as secret as possible
from receiver 2. The channel state information (CSI) is assumed to be known at
both the transmitter and the receivers. The secrecy capacity region is first
established for the parallel Gaussian BCC, and the optimal source power
allocations that achieve the boundary of the secrecy capacity region are
derived. In particular, the secrecy capacity region is established for the
Gaussian case of the Csiszar-Korner BCC model. The secrecy capacity results are
then applied to give the ergodic secrecy capacity region for the fading BCC.

This paper presents an interaction model adapted to mixed reality
environments known as IRVO (Interacting with Real and Virtual Objects). IRVO
aims at modeling the interaction between one or more users and the Mixed
Reality system by representing explicitly the objects and tools involved and
their relationship. IRVO covers the design phase of the life cycle and models
the intended use of the system. In a first part, we present a brief review of
related HCI models. The second part is devoted to the IRVO model, its notation
and some examples. In the third part, we present how IRVO is used for designing
applications and in particular we show how this model can be integrated in a
Model-Based Approach (CoCSys) which is currently designed at our lab.

In this work we present a technique of fast numerical computation for

of nonlinear ordinary differential equations using the geometrical shape of the
domain where the flow is developing, then these ODEs are numerically resolved
using a set of computations distributed among the available processors. We
present some results from simulations on a parallel hardware architecture using
native multithreads software and simulating a shared-memory or a

Random subgroups and analysis of the length-based and quotient attacks
2007-07-10

Myasnikov,Alexei G.
Ushakov,Alexander

In this paper we discuss generic properties of "random subgroups" of a given
group G. It turns out that in many groups G (even in most exotic of them) the
random subgroups have a simple algebraic structure and they "sit" inside G in a
very particular way. This gives a strong mathematical foundation for
cryptanalysis of several group-based cryptosystems and indicates on how to
chose "strong keys". To illustrate our technique we analyze the
Anshel-Anshel-Goldfeld (AAG) cryptosystem and give a mathematical explanation
of recent success of some heuristic length-based attacks on it. Furthermore, we
design and analyze a new type of attacks, which we term the quotient attacks.
Mathematical methods we develop here also indicate how one can try to choose
"parameters" in AAG to foil the attacks.

Properties of polynomial bases used in a line-surface intersection algorithm
2007-07-10
2009-02-27
Srijuntongsiri,Gun
Vavasis,Stephen A.

In [5], Srijuntongsiri and Vavasis propose the "Kantorovich-Test Subdivision
algorithm", or KTS, which is an algorithm for finding all zeros of a polynomial
system in a bounded region of the plane. This algorithm can be used to find the
intersections between a line and a surface. The main features of KTS are that
it can operate on polynomials represented in any basis that satisfies certain
conditions and that its efficiency has an upper bound that depends only on the
conditioning of the problem and the choice of the basis representing the
polynomial system.
  This article explores in detail the dependence of the efficiency of the KTS
algorithm on the choice of basis. Three bases are considered: the power, the
Bernstein, and the Chebyshev bases. These three bases satisfy the basis
properties required by KTS. Theoretically, Chebyshev case has the smallest
upper bound on its running time. The computational results, however, do not
show that Chebyshev case performs better than the other two.

Programming Telepathy: Implementing Quantum Non-Locality Games
2007-07-11
2009-07-29
Tafliovich,Anya
Hehner,Eric C. R.

Quantum pseudo-telepathy is an intriguing phenomenon which results from the
application of quantum information theory to communication complexity. To
demonstrate this phenomenon researchers in the field of quantum communication
complexity devised a number of quantum non-locality games. The setting of these
games is as follows: the players are separated so that no communication between
them is possible and are given a certain computational task. When the players
have access to a quantum resource called entanglement, they can accomplish the
task: something that is impossible in a classical setting. To an observer who
is unfamiliar with the laws of quantum mechanics it seems that the players
employ some sort of telepathy; that is, they somehow exchange information
without sharing a communication channel. This paper provides a formal framework
for specifying, implementing, and analysing quantum non-locality games.

Sorting and Selection in Posets
2007-07-10

Daskalakis,Constantinos
Karp,Richard M.
Mossel,Elchanan
Riesenfeld,Samantha
Verbin,Elad

Classical problems of sorting and searching assume an underlying linear
ordering of the objects being compared. In this paper, we study a more general
setting, in which some pairs of objects are incomparable. This generalization
is relevant in applications related to rankings in sports, college admissions,
or conference submissions. It also has potential applications in biology, such
as comparing the evolutionary fitness of different strains of bacteria, or
understanding input-output relations among a set of metabolic reactions or the
causal influences among a set of interacting genes or proteins. Our results
improve and extend results from two decades ago of Faigle and Tur\'{a}n.
  A measure of complexity of a partially ordered set (poset) is its width. Our
algorithms obtain information about a poset by queries that compare two
elements. We present an algorithm that sorts, i.e. completely identifies, a
width w poset of size n and has query complexity O(wn + nlog(n)), which is
within a constant factor of the information-theoretic lower bound. We also show
that a variant of Mergesort has query complexity O(wn(log(n/w))) and total
complexity O((w^2)nlog(n/w)). Faigle and Tur\'{a}n have shown that the sorting
problem has query complexity O(wn(log(n/w))) but did not address its total
complexity.
  For the related problem of determining the minimal elements of a poset, we
give efficient deterministic and randomized algorithms with O(wn) query and
total complexity, along with matching lower bounds for the query complexity up
to a factor of 2. We generalize these results to the k-selection problem of
determining the elements of height at most k. We also derive upper bounds on
the total complexity of some other problems of a similar flavor.

An Architecture Framework for Complex Data Warehouses

Nowadays, many decision support applications need to exploit data that are
not only numerical or symbolic, but also multimedia, multistructure,
multisource, multimodal, and/or multiversion. We term such data complex data.
Managing and analyzing complex data involves a lot of different issues
regarding their structure, storage and processing, and metadata are a key
element in all these processes. Such problems have been addressed by classical
data warehousing (i.e., applied to "simple" data). However, data warehousing
approaches need to be adapted for complex data. In this paper, we first propose
a precise, though open, definition of complex data. Then we present a general
architecture framework for warehousing complex data. This architecture heavily
relies on metadata and domain-related knowledge, and rests on the XML language,
which helps storing data, metadata and domain-specific knowledge altogether,
and facilitates communication between the various warehousing processes.

Data Mining-based Materialized View and Index Selection in Data Warehouses

Materialized views and indexes are physical structures for accelerating data
access that are casually used in data warehouses. However, these data
structures generate some maintenance overhead. They also share the same storage
space. Most existing studies about materialized view and index selection
consider these structures separately. In this paper, we adopt the opposite

interactions into account and achieve efficient storage space sharing.
Candidate materialized views and indexes are selected through a data mining
process. We also exploit cost models that evaluate the respective benefit of
indexing and view materialization, and help select a relevant configuration of
indexes and materialized views among the candidates. Experimental results show
that our strategy performs better than an independent selection of materialized
views and indexes.

Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs) are intense narrowly-beamed flashes of gamma-rays of
cosmological origin. They are among the most scientifically interesting
astrophysical systems, and the riddle concerning their central engines and
emission mechanisms is one of the most complex and challenging problems of
astrophysics today. In this article we outline our petascale approach to the
GRB problem and discuss the computational toolkits and numerical codes that are
currently in use and that will be scaled up to run on emerging petaflop scale
computing platforms in the near future.
  Petascale computing will require additional ingredients over conventional
parallelism. We consider some of the challenges which will be caused by future
petascale architectures, and discuss our plans for the future development of
the Cactus framework and its applications to meet these challenges in order to
profit from these new architectures.

The Trade-offs with Space Time Cube Representation of Spatiotemporal Patterns

Stahl,Josefin

Space time cube representation is an information visualization technique
where spatiotemporal data points are mapped into a cube. Fast and correct
analysis of such information is important in for instance geospatial and social
visualization applications. Information visualization researchers have
previously argued that space time cube representation is beneficial in
revealing complex spatiotemporal patterns in a dataset to users. The argument
is based on the fact that both time and spatial information are displayed
simultaneously to users, an effect difficult to achieve in other
representations. However, to our knowledge the actual usefulness of space time
cube representation in conveying complex spatiotemporal patterns to users has
not been empirically validated. To fill this gap we report on a
between-subjects experiment comparing novice users error rates and response
times when answering a set of questions using either space time cube or a
baseline 2D representation. For some simple questions the error rates were
lower when using the baseline representation. For complex questions where the
participants needed an overall understanding of the spatiotemporal structure of
the dataset, the space time cube representation resulted in on average twice as
fast response times with no difference in error rates compared to the baseline.
These results provide an empirical foundation for the hypothesis that space
time cube representation benefits users when analyzing complex spatiotemporal
patterns.

Interface groups and financial transfer architectures
2007-07-11

Bergstra,Jan A.
Ponse,Alban

Analytic execution architectures have been proposed by the same authors as a
means to conceptualize the cooperation between heterogeneous collectives of
components such as programs, threads, states and services. Interface groups
have been proposed as a means to formalize interface information concerning
analytic execution architectures. These concepts are adapted to organization
architectures with a focus on financial transfers. Interface groups (and
monoids) now provide a technique to combine interface elements into interfaces
with the flexibility to distinguish between directions of flow dependent on
entity naming.
  The main principle exploiting interface groups is that when composing a
closed system of a collection of interacting components, the sum of their
interfaces must vanish in the interface group modulo reflection. This certainly
matters for financial transfer interfaces.
  As an example of this, we specify an interface group and within it some
specific interfaces concerning the financial transfer architecture for a part
of our local academic organization.
  Financial transfer interface groups arise as a special case of more general
service architecture interfaces.

Fast and Simple Relational Processing of Uncertain Data

Antova,Lyublena
Jansen,Thomas
Koch,Christoph
Olteanu,Dan

This paper introduces U-relations, a succinct and purely relational
representation system for uncertain databases. U-relations support
attribute-level uncertainty using vertical partitioning. If we consider
positive relational algebra extended by an operation for computing possible
answers, a query on the logical level can be translated into, and evaluated as,
a single relational algebra query on the U-relation representation. The
translation scheme essentially preserves the size of the query in terms of
number of operations and, in particular, number of joins. Standard techniques
employed in off-the-shelf relational database management systems are effective
for optimizing and processing queries on U-relations. In our experiments we
show that query evaluation on U-relations scales to large amounts of data with
high degrees of uncertainty.

Sampling Algorithms and Coresets for Lp Regression

Dasgupta,Anirban
Drineas,Petros

Kumar,Ravi
Mahoney,Michael W.

The Lp regression problem takes as input a matrix $A \in \Real^{n \times d}$,
a vector $b \in \Real^n$, and a number $p \in [1,\infty)$, and it returns as
output a number ${\cal Z}$ and a vector $x_{opt} \in \Real^d$ such that ${\cal
Z} = \min_{x \in \Real^d} ||Ax -b||_p = ||Ax_{opt}-b||_p$. In this paper, we
construct coresets and obtain an efficient two-stage sampling-based
approximation algorithm for the very overconstrained ($n \gg d$) version of
this classical problem, for all $p \in [1, \infty)$. The first stage of our
algorithm non-uniformly samples $\hat{r}_1 = O(36^p d^{\max\{p/2+1, p\}+1})$
rows of $A$ and the corresponding elements of $b$, and then it solves the Lp
regression problem on the sample; we prove this is an 8-approximation. The
second stage of our algorithm uses the output of the first stage to resample
$\hat{r}_1/\epsilon^2$ constraints, and then it solves the Lp regression
problem on the new sample; we prove this is a $(1+\epsilon)$-approximation. Our
algorithm unifies, improves upon, and extends the existing algorithms for
special cases of Lp regression, namely $p = 1,2$. In course of proving our
result, we develop two concepts--well-conditioned bases and subspace-preserving
sampling--that are of independent interest.

Sources of Superlinearity in Davenport-Schinzel Sequences
2007-07-11

Pettie,Seth

A generalized Davenport-Schinzel sequence is one over a finite alphabet that
contains no subsequences isomorphic to a fixed forbidden subsequence. One of
the fundamental problems in this area is bounding (asymptotically) the maximum
length of such sequences. Following Klazar, let Ex(\sigma,n) be the maximum
length of a sequence over an alphabet of size n avoiding subsequences
isomorphic to \sigma. It has been proved that for every \sigma, Ex(\sigma,n) is
either linear or very close to linear; in particular it is O(n
2^{\alpha(n)^{O(1)}}), where \alpha is the inverse-Ackermann function and O(1)
depends on \sigma. However, very little is known about the properties of \sigma
that induce superlinearity of \Ex(\sigma,n).
  In this paper we exhibit an infinite family of independent superlinear
forbidden subsequences. To be specific, we show that there are 17 prototypical
superlinear forbidden subsequences, some of which can be made arbitrarily long
through a simple padding operation. Perhaps the most novel part of our
constructions is a new succinct code for representing superlinear forbidden
subsequences.

calculation. This is very important in Physics where we can work with numbers

On slow-fading non-separable correlation MIMO systems

Far,Reza Rashidi

Speicher,Roland

In a frequency selective slow-fading channel in a MIMO system, the channel
matrix is of the form of a block matrix. We propose a method to calculate the
limit of the eigenvalue distribution of block matrices if the size of the
blocks tends to infinity. We will also calculate the asymptotic eigenvalue
distribution of $HH^*$, where the entries of $H$ are jointly Gaussian, with a
correlation of the form $E[h_{pj}\bar h_{qk}]= \sum_{s=1}^t
\Psi^{(s)}_{jk}\hat\Psi^{(s)}_{pq}$ (where $t$ is fixed and does not increase
with the size of the matrix). We will use an operator-valued free probability
approach to achieve this goal. Using this method, we derive a system of
equations, which can be solved numerically to compute the desired eigenvalue
distribution.

Understanding the Properties of the BitTorrent Overlay
2007-07-12

Hamra,Anwar Al
Legout,Arnaud
Barakat,Chadi

In this paper, we conduct extensive simulations to understand the properties
of the overlay generated by BitTorrent. We start by analyzing how the overlay
properties impact the efficiency of BitTorrent. We focus on the average peer
set size (i.e., average number of neighbors), the time for a peer to reach its
maximum peer set size, and the diameter of the overlay. In particular, we show
that the later a peer arrives in a torrent, the longer it takes to reach its
maximum peer set size. Then, we evaluate the impact of the maximum peer set
size, the maximum number of outgoing connections per peer, and the number of
NATed peers on the overlay properties. We show that BitTorrent generates a
robust overlay, but that this overlay is not a random graph. In particular, the
connectivity of a peer to its neighbors depends on its arriving order in the
torrent. We also show that a large number of NATed peers significantly
compromise the robustness of the overlay to attacks. Finally, we evaluate the
impact of peer exchange on the overlay properties, and we show that it
generates a chain-like overlay with a large diameter, which will adversely
impact the efficiency of large torrents.

The Kinematics of Manipulators Built From Closed Planar Mechanisms

The paper discusses the kinematics of manipulators builts of planar closed
kinematic chains. A special kinematic scheme is extracted from the array of
these mechanisms that looks the most promising for the creation of different
types of robotic manipulators. The structural features of this manipulator
determine a number of its original properties that essentially simplify its
control. These features allow the main control problems to be effectively
overcome by application of the simple kinematic problems. The workspace and
singular configurations of a basic planar manipulator are studied. By using a
graphic simulation method, motions of the designed mechanism are examined. A
prototype of this mechanism was implemented to verify the proposed approach.

Generalized Solution Concepts in Games with Possibly Unaware Players
2007-07-12

Rego,Leandro C.
Halpern,Joseph Y.

Most work in game theory assumes that players are perfect reasoners and have
common knowledge of all significant aspects of the game. In earlier work, we
proposed a framework for representing and analyzing games with possibly unaware
players, and suggested a generalization of Nash equilibrium appropriate for
games with unaware players that we called generalized Nash equilibrium. Here,
we use this framework to analyze other solution concepts that have been
considered in the game-theory literature, with a focus on sequential
equilibrium. We also provide some insight into the notion of generalized Nash
equilibrium by proving that it is closely related to the notion of
rationalizability when we restrict the analysis to games in normal form and no
unawareness is involved.

Throughput Scaling Laws for Wireless Networks with Fading Channels
2007-07-12

Ebrahimi,Masoud
Maddah-Ali,Mohammad A.
Khandani,Amir K.

A network of n communication links, operating over a shared wireless channel,
is considered. Fading is assumed to be the dominant factor affecting the
strength of the channels between transmitter and receiver terminals. It is
assumed that each link can be active and transmit with a constant power P or
remain silent. The objective is to maximize the throughput over the selection
of active links. By deriving an upper bound and a lower bound, it is shown that
in the case of Rayleigh fading (i) the maximum throughput scales like $\log n$
(ii) the maximum throughput is achievable in a distributed fashion. The upper
bound is obtained using probabilistic methods, where the key point is to upper
bound the throughput of any random set of active links by a chi-squared random
variable. To obtain the lower bound, a decentralized link activation strategy
is proposed and analyzed.

Removing Manually-Generated Boilerplate from Electronic Texts: Experiments with Project Gutenberg e-Books

Kaser,Owen
Lemire,Daniel

Collaborative work on unstructured or semi-structured documents, such as in
literature corpora or source code, often involves agreed upon templates
containing metadata. These templates are not consistent across users and over
time. Rule-based parsing of these templates is expensive to maintain and tends
to fail as new documents are added. Statistical techniques based on frequent
occurrences have the potential to identify automatically a large fraction of
the templates, thus reducing the burden on the programmers. We investigate the
case of the Project Gutenberg corpus, where most documents are in ASCII format
with preambles and epilogues that are often copied and pasted or manually
typed. We show that a statistical approach can solve most cases though some
documents require knowledge of English. We also survey various technical
solutions that make our approach applicable to large data sets.

Bandlimited Field Reconstruction for Wireless Sensor Networks
2007-07-13

Nordio,A.
Chiasserini,C. -F.
Viterbo,E.

Wireless sensor networks are often used for environmental monitoring
applications. In this context sampling and reconstruction of a physical field
is one of the most important problems to solve. We focus on a bandlimited field
and find under which conditions on the network topology the reconstruction of
the field is successful, with a given probability. We review irregular sampling
theory, and analyze the problem using random matrix theory. We show that even a
very irregular spatial distribution of sensors may lead to a successful signal
reconstruction, provided that the number of collected samples is large enough
with respect to the field bandwidth. Furthermore, we give the basis to
analytically determine the probability of successful field reconstruction.

Moveability and Collision Analysis for Fully-Parallel Manipulators
2007-07-13

Chablat,Damien
Wenger,Philippe

The aim of this paper is to characterize the moveability of fully-parallel
manipulators in the presence of obstacles. Fully parallel manipulators are used
in applications where accuracy, stiffness or high speeds and accelerations are
required \cite{Merlet:97}. However, one of its main drawbacks is a relatively
small workspace compared to the one of serial manipulators. This is due mainly
to the existence of potential internal collisions, and the existence of
singularities. In this paper, the notion of free aspect is defined which
permits to exhibit domains of the workspace and the joint space free of
singularity and collision. The main application of this study is the
moveability analysis in the workspace of the manipulator as well as
path-planning, control and design.

A Normalizing Intuitionistic Set Theory with Inaccessible Sets
2007-07-13
2008-04-08
Moczydlowski,Wojciech

We propose a set theory strong enough to interpret powerful type theories
underlying proof assistants such as LEGO and also possibly Coq, which at the
same time enables program extraction from its constructive proofs. For this
purpose, we axiomatize an impredicative constructive version of
Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory IZF with Replacement and $\omega$-many
inaccessibles, which we call \izfio. Our axiomatization utilizes set terms, an
inductive definition of inaccessible sets and the mutually recursive nature of
equality and membership relations. It allows us to define a weakly-normalizing
typed lambda calculus corresponding to proofs in \izfio according to the
Curry-Howard isomorphism principle. We use realizability to prove the
normalization theorem, which provides a basis for program extraction
capability.

Working Modes and Aspects in Fully-Parallel Manipulator
2007-07-13

Chablat,Damien
Wenger,Philippe

The aim of this paper is to characterize the notion of aspect in the
workspace and in the joint space for parallel manipulators. In opposite to the
serial manipulators, the parallel manipulators can admit not only multiple
inverse kinematic solutions, but also multiple direct kinematic solutions. The
notion of aspect introduced for serial manipulators in [Borrel 86], and
redefined for parallel manipulators with only one inverse kinematic solution in
[Wenger 1997], is redefined for general fully parallel manipulators. Two
Jacobian matrices appear in the kinematic relations between the joint-rate and
the Cartesian-velocity vectors, which are called the "inverse kinematics" and
the "direct kinematics" matrices. The study of these matrices allow to
respectively define the parallel and the serial singularities. The notion of
working modes is introduced to separate inverse kinematic solutions. Thus, we
can find out domains of the workspace and the joint space exempt of
singularity. Application of this study is the moveability analysis in the
workspace of the manipulator as well as path-planing and control. This study is
illustrated in this paper with a RR-RRR planar parallel manipulator.

On the error exponent of variable-length block-coding schemes over finite-state Markov channels with feedback

Como,Giacomo

The error exponent of Markov channels with feedback is studied in the
variable-length block-coding setting. Burnashev's classic result is extended
and a single letter characterization for the reliability function of
finite-state Markov channels is presented, under the assumption that the
channel state is causally observed both at the transmitter and at the receiver
side. Tools from stochastic control theory are used in order to treat channels
with intersymbol interference. In particular the convex analytical approach to
Markov decision processes is adopted to handle problems with stopping time
horizons arising from variable-length coding schemes.

The Isoconditioning Loci of A Class of Closed-Chain Manipulators
2007-07-13

Chablat,Damien
Wenger,Philippe
Angeles,Jorge

The subject of this paper is a special class of closed-chain manipulators.
First, we analyze a family of two-degree-of-freedom (dof) five-bar planar
linkages. Two Jacobian matrices appear in the kinematic relations between the
joint-rate and the Cartesian-velocity vectors, which are called the ``inverse
kinematics" and the "direct kinematics" matrices. It is shown that the loci of
points of the workspace where the condition number of the direct-kinematics
matrix remains constant, i.e., the isoconditioning loci, are the coupler points
of the four-bar linkage obtained upon locking the middle joint of the linkage.
Furthermore, if the line of centers of the two actuated revolutes is used as
the axis of a third actuated revolute, then a three-dof hybrid manipulator is
obtained. The isoconditioning loci of this manipulator are surfaces of
revolution generated by the isoconditioning curves of the two-dof manipulator,
whose axis of symmetry is that of the third actuated revolute.

The goal of this paper is to explain, using a typical example, the
distribution of the different assembly modes in the workspace and their
effective role in the execution of trajectories. The singular and non-singular
changes of assembly mode are described and compared to each other. The
non-singular change of assembly mode is more deeply analysed and discussed in
the context of trajectory planning. In particular, it is shown that, according
to the location of the initial and final configurations with respect to the
uniqueness domains in the workspace, there are three different cases to
consider before planning a linking trajectory.

The aim of this paper is the isotropic design of a hybrid morphology
dedicated to 3-axis machining applications. It is necessary to ensure the
feasibility of continuous, singularity-free trajectories, as well as a good
manipulability in position and velocity. We want to propose an alternative
design to conventional serial machine-tools. We compare a serial PPP
machine-tool (three prismatic orthogonal axes) with a hybrid architecture which
we optimize only the first two axes. The critrerion used for the optimization
is the conditioning of the Jacobian matrices. The optimum, namely isotropy, can
be obtained which provides our architecture with excellent manipulability
properties.

A Training based Distributed Non-Coherent Space-Time Coding Strategy

Unitary space-time modulation is known to be an efficient means to
communicate over non-coherent Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) channels.
In this letter, differential unitary space-time coding and non-coherent
space-time coding for the training based approach of Kim and Tarokh are
addressed. For this approach, necessary and sufficient conditions for
multi-group decodability are derived in a simple way assuming a Generalized
Likelihood Ratio Test receiver and a unitary codebook. Extending Kim and
Tarokh's approach for colocated MIMO systems, a novel training based approach
to distributed non-coherent space-time coding for wireless relay networks is
proposed. An explicit construction of two-group decodable distributed
non-coherent space-time codes achieving full cooperative diversity for all even
number of relays is provided.

Splay Trees, Davenport-Schinzel Sequences, and the Deque Conjecture
2007-07-14

Pettie,Seth

We introduce a new technique to bound the asymptotic performance of splay
trees. The basic idea is to transcribe, in an indirect fashion, the rotations
performed by the splay tree as a Davenport-Schinzel sequence S, none of whose
subsequences are isomorphic to fixed forbidden subsequence. We direct this
technique towards Tarjan's deque conjecture and prove that n deque operations
require O(n alpha^*(n)) time, where alpha^*(n) is the minimum number of
applications of the inverse-Ackermann function mapping n to a constant. We are
optimistic that this approach could be directed towards other open conjectures
on splay trees such as the traversal and split conjectures.

Benefit of Delay on the Diversity-Multiplexing Tradeoffs of MIMO Channels with Partial CSI
2007-07-14

Sharif,Masoud
Ishwar,Prakash

This paper re-examines the well-known fundamental tradeoffs between rate and
reliability for the multi-antenna, block Rayleigh fading channel in the high
signal to noise ratio (SNR) regime when (i) the transmitter has access to
(noiseless) one bit per coherence-interval of causal channel state information
(CSI) and (ii) soft decoding delays together with worst-case delay guarantees
are acceptable. A key finding of this work is that substantial improvements in
reliability can be realized with a very short expected delay and a slightly
longer (but bounded) worst-case decoding delay guarantee in communication
systems where the transmitter has access to even one bit per coherence interval
of causal CSI. While similar in spirit to the recent work on communication
systems based on automatic repeat requests (ARQ) where decoding failure is
known at the transmitter and leads to re-transmission, here transmit
side-information is purely based on CSI. The findings reported here also lend
further support to an emerging understanding that decoding delay (related to
throughput) and codeword blocklength (related to coding complexity and delays)
are distinctly different design parameters which can be tuned to control
reliability.

Design of Multistage Decimation Filters Using Cyclotomic Polynomials: Optimization and Design Issues
2007-07-15

Laddomada,Massimiliano

This paper focuses on the design of multiplier-less decimation filters
suitable for oversampled digital signals. The aim is twofold. On one hand, it
proposes an optimization framework for the design of constituent decimation
filters in a general multistage decimation architecture. The basic building
blocks embedded in the proposed filters belong, for a simple reason, to the
class of cyclotomic polynomials (CPs): the first 104 CPs have a z-transfer
function whose coefficients are simply {-1,0,+1}. On the other hand, the paper
provides a bunch of useful techniques, most of which stemming from some key
properties of CPs, for designing the proposed filters in a variety of
architectures. Both recursive and non-recursive architectures are discussed by
focusing on a specific decimation filter obtained as a result of the
optimization algorithm.
  Design guidelines are provided with the aim to simplify the design of the
constituent decimation filters in the multistage chain.

Word statistics in Blogs and RSS feeds: Towards empirical universal evidence
2007-07-15

Lambiotte,R.
Ausloos,M.
Thelwall,M.

We focus on the statistics of word occurrences and of the waiting times
between such occurrences in Blogs. Due to the heterogeneity of words'
frequencies, the empirical analysis is performed by studying classes of
"frequently-equivalent" words, i.e. by grouping words depending on their
frequencies. Two limiting cases are considered: the dilute limit, i.e. for
those words that are used less than once a day, and the dense limit for
frequent words. In both cases, extreme events occur more frequently than
expected from the Poisson hypothesis. These deviations from Poisson statistics
reveal non-trivial time correlations between events that are associated with
bursts of activities. The distribution of waiting times is shown to behave like
a stretched exponential and to have the same shape for different sets of words
sharing a common frequency, thereby revealing universal features.

Degeneracy study of the forward kinematics of planar 3-RPR parallel manipulators
2007-07-15

Wenger,Philippe
Chablat,Damien
Zein,Mazen

This paper investigates two situations in which the forward kinematics of
planar 3-RPR parallel manipulators degenerates. These situations have not been
addressed before. The first degeneracy arises when the three input joint
variables r1, r2 and r3 satisfy a certain relationship. This degeneracy yields
a double root of the characteristic polynomial in t, which could be erroneously
interpreted as two coalesce assembly modes. But, unlike what arises in
non-degenerate cases, this double root yields two sets of solutions for the
position coordinates (x, y) of the platform. In the second situation, we show
that the forward kinematics degenerates over the whole joint space if the base
and platform triangles are congruent and the platform triangle is rotated by
180 deg about one of its sides. For these "degenerate" manipulators, which are
defined here for the first time, the forward kinematics is reduced to the
solution of a 3rd-degree polynomial and a quadratics in sequence. Such
manipulators constitute, in turn, a new family of analytic planar manipulators
that would be more suitable for industrial applications.

Kinematic Analysis of a Family of 3R Manipulators

The workspace topologies of a family of 3-revolute (3R) positioning
manipulators are enumerated. The workspace is characterized in a half-cross
section by the singular curves. The workspace topology is defined by the number
of cusps that appear on these singular curves. The design parameters space is
shown to be divided into five domains where all manipulators have the same
number of cusps. Each separating surface is given as an explicit expression in
the DH-parameters. As an application of this work, we provide a necessary and
sufficient condition for a 3R orthogonal manipulator to be cuspidal, i.e. to
change posture without meeting a singularity. This condition is set as an
explicit expression in the DH parameters.

The Computation of All 4R Serial Spherical Wrists With an Isotropic Architecture
2007-07-15

Chablat,Damien
Angeles,Jorge

A spherical wrist of the serial type with n revolute (R) joints is said to be
isotropic if it can attain a posture whereby the singular values of its
Jacobian matrix are all equal to sqrt(n/3). What isotropy brings about is
robustness to manufacturing, assembly, and measurement errors, thereby
guaranteeing a maximum orientation accuracy. In this paper we investigate the
existence of redundant isotropic architectures, which should add to the
dexterity of the wrist under design by virtue of its extra degree of freedom.
The problem formulation, for, leads to a system of eight quadratic equations
with eight unknowns. The Bezout number of this system is thus 2^8=256, its BKK
bound being 192. However, the actual number of solutions is shown to be 32. We
list all solutions of the foregoing algebraic problem. All these solutions are
real, but distinct solutions do not necessarily lead to distinct manipulators.
Upon discarding those algebraic solutions that yield no new wrists, we end up
with exactly eight distinct architectures, the eight corresponding manipulators
being displayed at their isotropic postures.

A design oriented study for 3R Orthogonal Manipulators With Geometric Simplifications

This paper proposes a method to calculate the largest Regular Dextrous
Workspace (RDW) of some types of three-revolute orthogonal manipulators that
have at least one of their DH parameters equal to zero. Then a new performance
index based on the RDW is introduced, the isocontours of this index are plotted
in the parameter space of the interesting types of manipulators and finally an
inspection of the domains of the parameter spaces is conducted in order to
identify the better manipulator architectures. The RDW is a part of the
workspace whose shape is regular (cube, cylinder) and the performances
(conditioning index) are bounded inside. The groups of 3R orthogonal
manipulators studied have interesting kinematic properties such as, a
well-connected workspace that is fully reachable with four inverse kinematic
solutions and that does not contain any void. This study is of high interest
for the design of alternative manipulator geometries.

parameters. Moreover, the optimum value is convex with respect to these
parameters. Examples motivated by optimizations for communication systems are

result of this migration is made available as an open-source project, which is

with conducting this case study and reflect on the success and challenges of
the migration process, as well as on the feasibility of automatic aspect

Worm Epidemics in Wireless Adhoc Networks
2007-07-16

Nekovee,Maziar

A dramatic increase in the number of computing devices with wireless
communication capability has resulted in the emergence of a new class of
computer worms which specifically target such devices. The most striking
feature of these worms is that they do not require Internet connectivity for
their propagation but can spread directly from device to device using a
short-range radio communication technology, such as WiFi or Bluetooth. In this
paper, we develop a new model for epidemic spreading of these worms and
investigate their spreading in wireless ad hoc networks via extensive Monte
Carlo simulations. Our studies show that the threshold behaviour and dynamics
of worm epidemics in these networks are greatly affected by a combination of
spatial and temporal correlations which characterize these networks, and are
significantly different from the previously studied epidemics in the Internet.

We propose several new schedules for Strassen-Winograd's matrix

by three different means: by introducing a few pre-additions, by overwriting

multiplication. In particular, we show two fully in-place schedules: one having
the same number of operations, if the input matrices can be overwritten; the
other one, slightly increasing the constant of the leading term of the
complexity, if the input matrices are read-only. Many of these schedules have
been found by an implementation of an exhaustive search algorithm based on a
pebble game.

Tripartitions do not always discriminate phylogenetic networks
2007-07-16

Cardona,Gabriel
Rossello,Francesc
Valiente,Gabriel

Phylogenetic networks are a generalization of phylogenetic trees that allow
for the representation of non-treelike evolutionary events, like recombination,
hybridization, or lateral gene transfer. In a recent series of papers devoted
to the study of reconstructibility of phylogenetic networks, Moret, Nakhleh,
Warnow and collaborators introduced the so-called {tripartition metric for
phylogenetic networks. In this paper we show that, in fact, this tripartition
metric does not satisfy the separation axiom of distances (zero distance means
isomorphism, or, in a more relaxed version, zero distance means
indistinguishability in some specific sense) in any of the subclasses of
phylogenetic networks where it is claimed to do so. We also present a subclass
of phylogenetic networks whose members can be singled out by means of their
sets of tripartitions (or even clusters), and hence where the latter can be
used to define a meaningful metric.

On the Polyphase Decomposition for Design of Generalized Comb Decimation Filters
2007-07-17

Laddomada,Massimiliano

Generalized comb filters (GCFs) are efficient anti-aliasing decimation
filters with improved selectivity and quantization noise (QN) rejection
performance around the so called folding bands with respect to classical comb
filters.
  In this paper, we address the design of GCF filters by proposing an efficient
partial polyphase architecture with the aim to reduce the data rate as much as
possible after the Sigma-Delta A/D conversion. We propose a mathematical
framework in order to completely characterize the dependence of the frequency
response of GCFs on the quantization of the multipliers embedded in the
proposed filter architecture. This analysis paves the way to the design of
multiplier-less decimation architectures.
  We also derive the impulse response of a sample 3rd order GCF filter used as
a reference scheme throughout the paper.

finite-horizon control of a decentralized Pomdp (Dec-Pomdp). This is a problem
of very high complexity (NEXP-hard in n >= 2). In this paper, we propose a new
mathematical programming approach for the problem. Our approach is based on two
ideas: First, we represent each agent's policy in the sequence-form and not in
the tree-form, thereby obtaining a very compact representation of the set of
joint-policies. Second, using this compact representation, we solve this
problem as an instance of combinatorial optimization for which we formulate a
mixed integer linear program (MILP). The optimal solution of the MILP directly
yields an optimal joint-policy for the Dec-Pomdp. Computational experience
shows that formulating and solving the MILP requires significantly less time to
solve benchmark Dec-Pomdp problems than existing algorithms. For example, the
multi-agent tiger problem for horizon 4 is solved in 72 secs with the MILP
whereas existing algorithms require several hours to solve it.

Link adaptation, in particular adaptive coded modulation (ACM), is a
promising tool for bandwidth-efficient transmission in a fading environment.
The main motivation behind employing ACM schemes is to improve the spectral
efficiency of wireless communication systems. In this paper, using a finite
number of capacity achieving component codes, we propose new transmission
schemes employing constant power transmission, as well as discrete and
continuous power adaptation, for slowly varying flat-fading channels.
  We show that the proposed transmission schemes can achieve throughputs close
to the Shannon limits of flat-fading channels using only a small number of
codes. Specifically, using a fully discrete scheme with just four codes, each
associated with four power levels, we achieve a spectral efficiency within 1 dB
of the continuous-rate continuous-power Shannon capacity. Furthermore, when
restricted to a fixed number of codes, the introduction of power adaptation has
significant gains with respect to ASE and probability of no transmission
compared to a constant power scheme.

A Characterisation of First-Order Constraint Satisfaction Problems

Larose,Benoit
Loten,Cynthia
Tardif,Claude

We describe simple algebraic and combinatorial characterisations of finite
relational core structures admitting finitely many obstructions. As a
consequence, we show that it is decidable to determine whether a constraint
satisfaction problem is first-order definable: we show the general problem to
be NP-complete, and give a polynomial-time algorithm in the case of cores. A
slight modification of this algorithm provides, for first-order definable
CSP's, a simple poly-time algorithm to produce a solution when one exists. As
an application of our algebraic characterisation of first order CSP's, we
describe a large family of L-complete CSP's.

A fixed point iteration for computing the matrix logarithm
2007-07-18

Schaller,Gernot

In various areas of applied numerics, the problem of calculating the
logarithm of a matrix A emerges. Since series expansions of the logarithm
usually do not converge well for matrices far away from the identity, the
standard numerical method calculates successive square roots. In this article,
a new algorithm is presented that relies on the computation of successive
matrix exponentials. Convergence of the method is demonstrated for a large
class of initial matrices and favorable choices of the initial matrix are
discussed.

Animation of virtual mannequins, robot-like simulation or motion captures
2007-07-18

Chablat,Damien

In order to optimize the costs and time of design of the new products while
improving their quality, concurrent engineering is based on the digital model
of these products, the numerical model. However, in order to be able to avoid
definitively physical model, old support of the design, without loss of
information, new tools must be available. Especially, a tool making it possible
to check simply and quickly the maintainability of complex mechanical sets
using the numerical model is necessary. Since one decade, our team works on the
creation of tool for the generation and the analysis of trajectories of virtual
mannequins. The simulation of human tasks can be carried out either by
robot-like simulation or by simulation by motion capture. This paper presents
some results on the both two methods. The first method is based on a
multi-agent system and on a digital mock-up technology, to assess an efficient
path planner for a manikin or a robot for access and visibility task taking
into account ergonomic constraints or joint and mechanical limits. In order to
solve this problem, the human operator is integrated in the process
optimization to contribute to a global perception of the environment. This
operator cooperates, in real-time, with several automatic local elementary
agents. In the case of the second approach, we worked with the CEA and EADS/CCR
to solve the constraints related to the evolution of human virtual in its
environment on the basis of data resulting from motion capture system. An
approach using of the virtual guides was developed to allow to the user the
realization of precise trajectory in absence of force feedback. The result of
this work validates solutions through the digital mock-up; it can be applied to
simulate maintenability and mountability tasks.

The kinematic properties of mechanisms are well known by the researchers and
teachers. The theory based on the study of Jacobian matrices allows us to
explain, for example, the singular configuration. However, in many cases, the
physical sense of such properties is difficult to explain to students. The aim
of this article is to use haptic feedback to render to the user the
signification of different kinematic indices. The framework uses a Phantom Omni
and a serial and parallel mechanism with two degrees of freedom. The
end-effector of both mechanisms can be moved either by classical mouse, or
Phantom Omni with or without feedback.

On the ergodic sum-rate performance of CDD in multi-user systems
2007-07-18

Sezgin,Aydin
Charafeddine,Mohamad
Paulraj,Arogyaswami

The main focus of space-time coding design and analysis for MIMO systems has
been so far focused on single-user systems. For single-user systems, transmit
diversity schemes suffer a loss in spectral efficiency if the receiver is
equipped with more than one antenna, making them unsuitable for high rate
transmission. One such transmit diversity scheme is the cyclic delay diversity
code (CDD). The advantage of CDD over other diversity schemes such as
orthogonal space-time block codes (OSTBC) is that a code rate of one and delay
optimality are achieved independent of the number of transmit antennas. In this
work we analyze the ergodic rate of a multi-user multiple access channel (MAC)
with each user applying such a cyclic delay diversity (CDD) code. We derive
closed form expressions for the ergodic sum-rate of multi-user CDD and compare
it with the sum-capacity. We study the ergodic rate region and show that in
contrast to what is conventionally known regarding the single-user case,
transmit diversity schemes are viable candidates for high rate transmission in
multi-user systems. Finally, our theoretical findings are illustrated by
numerical simulation results.

Distributed Compression and Multiparty Squashed Entanglement

Avis,David

We study a protocol in which many parties use quantum communication to
transfer a shared state to a receiver without communicating with each other.
This protocol is a multiparty version of the fully quantum Slepian-Wolf
protocol for two senders and arises through the repeated application of the
two-sender protocol. We describe bounds on the achievable rate region for the
distributed compression problem. The inner bound arises by expressing the
achievable rate region for our protocol in terms of its vertices and extreme
rays and, equivalently, in terms of facet inequalities. We also prove an outer
bound on all possible rates for distributed compression based on the multiparty
squashed entanglement, a measure of multiparty entanglement.

Multimedia Capacity Analysis of the IEEE 802.11e Contention-based Infrastructure Basic Service Set

Inan,Inanc
Keceli,Feyza
Ayanoglu,Ender

We first propose a simple mathematical analysis framework for the Enhanced
Distributed Channel Access (EDCA) function of the recently ratified IEEE
802.11e standard. Our analysis considers the fact that the distributed random
access systems exhibit cyclic behavior. The proposed model is valid for
arbitrary assignments of AC-specific Arbitration Interframe Space (AIFS) values
and Contention Window (CW) sizes and is the first that considers an arbitrary
distribution of active Access Categories (ACs) at the stations. Validating the
theoretical results via extensive simulations, we show that the proposed
analysis accurately captures the EDCA saturation performance. Next, we propose
a framework for multimedia capacity analysis of the EDCA function. We calculate
an accurate station- and AC-specific queue utilization ratio by appropriately
weighing the service time predictions of the cycle time model for different
number of active stations. Based on the calculated queue utilization ratio, we
design a simple model-based admission control scheme. We show that the proposed
call admission control algorithm maintains satisfactory user-perceived quality
for coexisting voice and video connections in an infrastructure BSS and does
not present over- or under-admission problems of previously proposed models in
the literature.

A classification of a family of 3-revolute (3R) positining manipulators is

The workspace is characterized in a half-cross section by the singular curves.
The workspace topology is defined by the number of cusps and nodes that appear
on these singular curves. The design parameters space is shown to be divided
into nine domains of distinct workspace topologies, in which all manipulators
have similar global kinematic properties. Each separating surface is given as
an explicit expression in the DH-parameters.

Covering a line segment with variable radius discs

Pacifici,Andrea

The paper addresses the problem of locating sensors with a circular field of
view so that a given line segment is under full surveillance, which is termed
as the Disc Covering Problem on a Line. The cost of each sensor includes a
fixed component, and a variable component that is proportional to the
field-of-view area. When only one type of sensor or, in general, one type of
disc, is available, then a simple polynomial algorithm solves the problem. When
there are different types of sensors in terms of fixed and variable costs, the
problem becomes NP-hard. A branch-and-bound algorithm as well as an efficient
heuristic are developed. The heuristic very often obtains the optimal solution
as shown in extensive computational testing.

the actual probability densities of the observations are located in
neighborhoods obtained by placing a bound on the relative entropy between

is characterized. The robust test applies a nonlinear transformation which
flattens the nominal likelihood ratio in the vicinity of one. Results are
illustrated by considering the transmission of binary data in the presence of
additive noise.

Instrumented Collective Learning Situations (ICLS): the Gap between Theoretical Research and Observed Practices

According to socio-constructivism approach, collective situations are
promoted to favor learning in classroom, at a distance or in a blended
educational context. So, many Information and Communication Technologies (ICT)
are provided to teachers but there are no clear studies about the way they are
used and perceived. Our research is based on the hypothesis that practices of
educational actors (instructional designers and tutors) are far away from
theoretical results of research in education technologies. In this paper, we
consider a precise kind of situation: Instrumented Collective Learning
Situations (ICLS). By a survey on 13 fields in higher education in France,
Switzerland and Canada, we present how ICLS are designed and how teachers used
them. Conclusions give an indication on the gap between the way information
technologies are prescribed and the way they are actually used and perceived by
teachers.

In this paper, we present the results from over-the-air experiments of a
complete implementation of an amplify and forward cooperative communications
system. Our custom OFDM-based physical layer uses a distributed version of the
Alamouti block code, where the relay sends one branch of Alamouti encoded
symbols. First we show analytically and experimentally that amplify and forward
protocols are unaffected by carrier frequency offsets at the relay. This result
allows us to use a conventional Alamouti receiver without change for the
distributed relay system. Our full system implementation shows gains up to
5.5dB in peak power constrained networks. Thus, we can conclusively state that
even the simplest form of relaying can lead to significant gains in practical
implementations.

This work aims at optimizing injection networks, which consist in adding a

networks so as to improve connectivity and overcome network partitioning. To
this end, we rely on small-world network properties, that comprise a high
clustering coefficient and a low characteristic path length. We investigate the
use of two genetic algorithms (generational and steady-state) to optimize three
instances of this topology control problem and present results that show
initial evidence of their capacity to solve it.

p-Adic Modelling of the Genome and the Genetic Code

The present paper is devoted to foundations of p-adic modelling in genomics.
Considering nucleotides, codons, DNA and RNA sequences, amino acids, and
proteins as information systems, we have formulated the corresponding p-adic
formalisms for their investigations. Each of these systems has its
characteristic prime number used for construction of the related information
space. Relevance of this approach is illustrated by some examples. In
particular, it is shown that degeneration of the genetic code is a p-adic
phenomenon. We have also put forward a hypothesis on evolution of the genetic
code assuming that primitive code was based on single nucleotides and
chronologically first four amino acids. This formalism of p-adic genomic
information systems can be implemented in computer programs and applied to
various concrete cases.

We consider an agent interacting with an unmodeled environment. At each time,
the agent makes an observation, takes an action, and incurs a cost. Its actions
can influence future observations and costs. The goal is to minimize the
long-term average cost. We propose a novel algorithm, known as the active LZ
algorithm, for optimal control based on ideas from the Lempel-Ziv scheme for
universal data compression and prediction. We establish that, under the active
LZ algorithm, if there exists an integer $K$ such that the future is
conditionally independent of the past given a window of $K$ consecutive actions
and observations, then the average cost converges to the optimum. Experimental
results involving the game of Rock-Paper-Scissors illustrate merits of the
algorithm.

Channel Capacity Estimation using Free Probability Theory
2007-07-20
2008-05-15
Ryan,Øyvind
Debbah,Merouane

In many channel measurement applications, one needs to estimate some
characteristics of the channels based on a limited set of measurements. This is
mainly due to the highly time varying characteristics of the channel. In this
contribution, it will be shown how free probability can be used for channel
capacity estimation in MIMO systems. Free probability has already been applied
in various application fields such as digital communications, nuclear physics
and mathematical finance, and has been shown to be an invaluable tool for
describing the asymptotic behaviour of many large-dimensional systems. In
particular, using the concept of free deconvolution, we provide an
asymptotically (w.r.t. the number of observations) unbiased capacity estimator
for MIMO channels impaired with noise called the free probability based
estimator. Another estimator, called the Gaussian matrix mean based estimator,
is also introduced by slightly modifying the free probability based estimator.
This estimator is shown to give unbiased estimation of the moments of the
channel matrix for any number of observations. Also, the estimator has this
property when we extend to MIMO channels with phase off-set and frequency
drift, for which no estimator has been provided so far in the literature. It is
also shown that both the free probability based and the Gaussian matrix mean
based estimator are asymptotically unbiased capacity estimators as the number
of transmit antennas go to infinity, regardless of whether phase off-set and
frequency drift are present. The limitations in the two estimators are also
explained. Simulations are run to assess the performance of the estimators for
a low number of antennas and samples to confirm the usefulness of the
asymptotic results.

Inductive Definition and Domain Theoretic Properties of Fully Abstract
2007-07-20
2007-09-10
Sazonov,Vladimir

A construction of fully abstract typed models for PCF and PCF^+ (i.e., PCF +
"parallel conditional function"), respectively, is presented. It is based on
general notions of sequential computational strategies and wittingly consistent
non-deterministic strategies introduced by the author in the seventies.
Although these notions of strategies are old, the definition of the fully
abstract models is new, in that it is given level-by-level in the finite type
hierarchy. To prove full abstraction and non-dcpo domain theoretic properties
of these models, a theory of computational strategies is developed. This is
also an alternative and, in a sense, an analogue to the later game strategy
semantics approaches of Abramsky, Jagadeesan, and Malacaria; Hyland and Ong;
and Nickau. In both cases of PCF and PCF^+ there are definable universal
(surjective) functionals from numerical functions to any given type,
respectively, which also makes each of these models unique up to isomorphism.
Although such models are non-omega-complete and therefore not continuous in the
traditional terminology, they are also proved to be sequentially complete (a
weakened form of omega-completeness), "naturally" continuous (with respect to
existing directed "pointwise", or "natural" lubs) and also "naturally"
omega-algebraic and "naturally" bounded complete -- appropriate generalisation
of the ordinary notions of domain theory to the case of non-dcpos.

Stacked OSTBC: Error Performance and Rate Analysis
2007-07-20

Sezgin,Aydin
Henkel,Oliver

It is well known, that the Alamouti scheme is the only space-time code from
orthogonal design achieving the capacity of a multiple-input multiple-output
(MIMO) wireless communication system with n_T=2 transmit antennas and n_R=1
receive antenna. In this work, we propose the n-times stacked Alamouti scheme
for n_T=2n transmit antennas and show that this scheme achieves the capacity in
the case of n_R=1 receive antenna. This result may regarded as an extension of
the Alamouti case. For the more general case of more than one receive antenna,
we show that if the number of transmit antennas is higher than the number of
receive antennas we achieve a high portion of the capacity with this scheme.
Further, we show that the MIMO capacity is at most twice the rate achieved with
the proposed scheme for all SNR. We derive lower and upper bounds for the rate
achieved with this scheme and compare it with upper and lower bounds for the
capacity. In addition to the capacity analysis based on the assumption of a
coherent channel, we analyze the error rate performance of the stacked OSTBC
with the optimal ML detector and with the suboptimal lattice-reduction (LR)
aided zero-forcing detector. We compare the error rate performance of the
stacked OSTBC with spatial multiplexing (SM) and full-diversity achieving
schemes. Finally, we illustrate the theoretical results by numerical
simulations.

Kinematic and stiffness analysis of the Orthoglide, a PKM with simple, regular workspace and homogeneous performances

The Orthoglide is a Delta-type PKM dedicated to 3-axis rapid machining
applications that was originally developed at IRCCyN in 2000-2001 to meet the
advantages of both serial 3-axis machines (regular workspace and homogeneous
performances) and parallel kinematic architectures (good dynamic performances
and stiffness). This machine has three fixed parallel linear joints that are
mounted orthogonally. The geometric parameters of the Orthoglide were defined
as function of the size of a prescribed cubic Cartesian workspace that is free
of singularities and internal collision. The interesting features of the
Orthoglide are a regular Cartesian workspace shape, uniform performances in all
directions and good compactness. In this paper, a new method is proposed to
analyze the stiffness of overconstrained Delta-type manipulators, such as the
Orthoglide. The Orthoglide is then benchmarked according to geometric,
kinematic and stiffness criteria: workspace to footprint ratio, velocity and
force transmission factors, sensitivity to geometric errors, torsional
stiffness and translational stiffness.

Neutrality and Many-Valued Logics

In this book, we consider various many-valued logics: standard, linear,
hyperbolic, parabolic, non-Archimedean, p-adic, interval, neutrosophic, etc. We
survey also results which show the tree different proof-theoretic frameworks
for many-valued logics, e.g. frameworks of the following deductive calculi:
Hilbert's style, sequent, and hypersequent. We present a general way that
allows to construct systematically analytic calculi for a large family of
non-Archimedean many-valued logics: hyperrational-valued, hyperreal-valued, and
p-adic valued logics characterized by a special format of semantics with an
appropriate rejection of Archimedes' axiom. These logics are built as different
extensions of standard many-valued logics (namely, Lukasiewicz's, Goedel's,
Product, and Post's logics). The informal sense of Archimedes' axiom is that
anything can be measured by a ruler. Also logical multiple-validity without
Archimedes' axiom consists in that the set of truth values is infinite and it
is not well-founded and well-ordered. On the base of non-Archimedean valued
logics, we construct non-Archimedean valued interval neutrosophic logic INL by
which we can describe neutrality phenomena.

Estimation of Small s-t Reliabilities in Acyclic Networks
2007-07-21

Laumanns,Marco
Zenklusen,Rico

In the classical s-t network reliability problem a fixed network G is given
including two designated vertices s and t (called terminals). The edges are
subject to independent random failure, and the task is to compute the
probability that s and t are connected in the resulting network, which is known
to be #P-complete. In this paper we are interested in approximating the s-t
reliability in case of a directed acyclic original network G. We introduce and
analyze a specialized version of the Monte-Carlo algorithm given by Karp and
Luby. For the case of uniform edge failure probabilities, we give a worst-case
bound on the number of samples that have to be drawn to obtain an epsilon-delta
approximation, being sharper than the original upper bound. We also derive a
variance reduction of the estimator which reduces the expected number of
iterations to perform to achieve the desired accuracy when applied in
conjunction with different stopping rules. Initial computational results on two
types of random networks (directed acyclic Delaunay graphs and a slightly
modified version of a classical random graph) with up to one million vertices
are presented. These results show the advantage of the introduced Monte-Carlo
approach compared to direct simulation when small reliabilities have to be
estimated and demonstrate its applicability on large-scale instances.

Decentralized sequential change detection using physical layer fusion
2007-07-22
2008-08-04
Zacharias,Leena
Sundaresan,Rajesh

The problem of decentralized sequential detection with conditionally
independent observations is studied. The sensors form a star topology with a
central node called fusion center as the hub. The sensors make noisy
observations of a parameter that changes from an initial state to a final state
at a random time where the random change time has a geometric distribution. The
sensors amplify and forward the observations over a wireless Gaussian multiple
access channel and operate under either a power constraint or an energy
constraint. The optimal transmission strategy at each stage is shown to be the
one that maximizes a certain Ali-Silvey distance between the distributions for
the hypotheses before and after the change. Simulations demonstrate that the
proposed analog technique has lower detection delays when compared with
existing schemes. Simulations further demonstrate that the energy-constrained
formulation enables better use of the total available energy than the
power-constrained formulation in the change detection problem.

Statistical mechanical analysis of the linear vector channel in digital communication
2007-07-23
2007-11-06
Takeda,Koujin
Hatabu,Atsushi
Kabashima,Yoshiyuki

A statistical mechanical framework to analyze linear vector channel models in
digital wireless communication is proposed for a large system. The framework is
a generalization of that proposed for code-division multiple-access systems in
Europhys. Lett. 76 (2006) 1193 and enables the analysis of the system in which
the elements of the channel transfer matrix are statistically correlated with
each other. The significance of the proposed scheme is demonstrated by
assessing the performance of an existing model of multi-input multi-output
communication systems.

Consistency of the group Lasso and multiple kernel learning
2007-07-23
2008-01-28
Bach,Francis

We consider the least-square regression problem with regularization by a
block 1-norm, i.e., a sum of Euclidean norms over spaces of dimensions larger
than one. This problem, referred to as the group Lasso, extends the usual
regularization by the 1-norm where all spaces have dimension one, where it is
commonly referred to as the Lasso. In this paper, we study the asymptotic model
consistency of the group Lasso. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions
for the consistency of group Lasso under practical assumptions, such as model
misspecification. When the linear predictors and Euclidean norms are replaced
by functions and reproducing kernel Hilbert norms, the problem is usually
referred to as multiple kernel learning and is commonly used for learning from
heterogeneous data sources and for non linear variable selection. Using tools
from functional analysis, and in particular covariance operators, we extend the
consistency results to this infinite dimensional case and also propose an
adaptive scheme to obtain a consistent model estimate, even when the necessary
condition required for the non adaptive scheme is not satisfied.

Faster subsequence recognition in compressed strings
2007-07-23
2008-01-18
Tiskin,Alexander

Computation on compressed strings is one of the key approaches to processing
massive data sets. We consider local subsequence recognition problems on
strings compressed by straight-line programs (SLP), which is closely related to
Lempel--Ziv compression. For an SLP-compressed text of length $\bar m$, and an
uncompressed pattern of length $n$, C{\'e}gielski et al. gave an algorithm for
local subsequence recognition running in time $O(\bar mn^2 \log n)$. We improve
the running time to $O(\bar mn^{1.5})$. Our algorithm can also be used to
compute the longest common subsequence between a compressed text and an
uncompressed pattern in time $O(\bar mn^{1.5})$; the same problem with a
compressed pattern is known to be NP-hard.

Faster exon assembly by sparse spliced alignment
2007-07-23

Tiskin,Alexander

Assembling a gene from candidate exons is an important problem in
computational biology. Among the most successful approaches to this problem is
\emph{spliced alignment}, proposed by Gelfand et al., which scores different
candidate exon chains within a DNA sequence of length $m$ by comparing them to
a known related gene sequence of length n, $m = \Theta(n)$. Gelfand et al.\
gave an algorithm for spliced alignment running in time O(n^3). Kent et al.\
considered sparse spliced alignment, where the number of candidate exons is
O(n), and proposed an algorithm for this problem running in time O(n^{2.5}). We
improve on this result, by proposing an algorithm for sparse spliced alignment
running in time O(n^{2.25}). Our approach is based on a new framework of
\emph{quasi-local string comparison}.

A Knowledge-Based Analysis of Global Function Computation
2007-07-23

Halpern,Joseph Y.
Petride,Sabina

Consider a distributed system N in which each agent has an input value and
each communication link has a weight. Given a global function, that is, a
function f whose value depends on the whole network, the goal is for every
agent to eventually compute the value f(N). We call this problem global
function computation. Various solutions for instances of this problem, such as
Boolean function computation, leader election, (minimum) spanning tree
construction, and network determination, have been proposed, each under
particular assumptions about what processors know about the system and how this
knowledge can be acquired. We give a necessary and sufficient condition for the
problem to be solvable that generalizes a number of well-known results. We then
provide a knowledge-based (kb) program (like those of Fagin, Halpern, Moses,
and Vardi) that solves global function computation whenever possible. Finally,
we improve the message overhead inherent in our initial kb program by giving a
counterfactual belief-based program that also solves the global function
computation whenever possible, but where agents send messages only when they
believe it is necessary to do so. The latter program is shown to be implemented
by a number of well-known algorithms for solving leader election.

Zero-automatic queues and product form
2007-07-23

Dao-Thi,Thu-Ha
Mairesse,Jean

We introduce and study a new model: 0-automatic queues. Roughly, 0-automatic
queues are characterized by a special buffering mechanism evolving like a
random walk on some infinite group or monoid. The salient result is that all
stable 0-automatic queues have a product form stationary distribution and a
Poisson output process. When considering the two simplest and extremal cases of
0-automatic queues, we recover the simple M/M/1 queue, and Gelenbe's G-queue
with positive and negative customers.

A Generalized Information Formula as the Bridge between Shannon and Popper
2007-07-23

Lu,Chenguang

A generalized information formula related to logical probability and fuzzy
set is deduced from the classical information formula. The new information
measure accords with to Popper's criterion for knowledge evolution very much.
In comparison with square error criterion, the information criterion does not
only reflect error of a proposition, but also reflects the particularity of the
event described by the proposition. It gives a proposition with less logical
probability higher evaluation. The paper introduces how to select a prediction
or sentence from many for forecasts and language translations according to the
generalized information criterion. It also introduces the rate fidelity theory,
which comes from the improvement of the rate distortion theory in the classical
information theory by replacing distortion (i.e. average error) criterion with
the generalized mutual information criterion, for data compression and
communication efficiency. Some interesting conclusions are obtained from the
rate-fidelity function in relation to image communication. It also discusses
how to improve Popper's theory.

Lattices for Distributed Source Coding: Jointly Gaussian Sources and Reconstruction of a Linear Function
2007-07-23

Krithivasan,D.
Pradhan,S. S.

Consider a pair of correlated Gaussian sources (X1,X2). Two separate encoders
observe the two components and communicate compressed versions of their
observations to a common decoder. The decoder is interested in reconstructing a
linear combination of X1 and X2 to within a mean-square distortion of D. We
obtain an inner bound to the optimal rate-distortion region for this problem. A
portion of this inner bound is achieved by a scheme that reconstructs the
linear function directly rather than reconstructing the individual components
X1 and X2 first. This results in a better rate region for certain parameter
values. Our coding scheme relies on lattice coding techniques in contrast to
more prevalent random coding arguments used to demonstrate achievable rate
regions in information theory. We then consider the case of linear
reconstruction of K sources and provide an inner bound to the optimal
rate-distortion region. Some parts of the inner bound are achieved using the
following coding structure: lattice vector quantization followed by
"correlated" lattice-structured binning.

Separable and Low-Rank Continuous Games
2007-07-24

Stein,Noah D.
Ozdaglar,Asuman
Parrilo,Pablo A.

In this paper, we study nonzero-sum separable games, which are continuous
games whose payoffs take a sum-of-products form. Included in this subclass are
all finite games and polynomial games. We investigate the structure of
equilibria in separable games. We show that these games admit finitely
supported Nash equilibria. Motivated by the bounds on the supports of mixed
equilibria in two-player finite games in terms of the ranks of the payoff
matrices, we define the notion of the rank of an n-player continuous game and
use this to provide bounds on the cardinality of the support of equilibrium
strategies. We present a general characterization theorem that states that a
continuous game has finite rank if and only if it is separable. Using our rank
results, we present an efficient algorithm for computing approximate equilibria
of two-player separable games with fixed strategy spaces in time polynomial in
the rank of the game.

Quantum Algorithms for Learning and Testing Juntas
2007-07-24

Atici,Alp
Servedio,Rocco A.

In this article we develop quantum algorithms for learning and testing
juntas, i.e. Boolean functions which depend only on an unknown set of k out of
n input variables. Our aim is to develop efficient algorithms:
  - whose sample complexity has no dependence on n, the dimension of the domain
the Boolean functions are defined over;
  - with no access to any classical or quantum membership ("black-box")
queries. Instead, our algorithms use only classical examples generated
uniformly at random and fixed quantum superpositions of such classical
examples;
  - which require only a few quantum examples but possibly many classical
random examples (which are considered quite "cheap" relative to quantum
examples).
  Our quantum algorithms are based on a subroutine FS which enables sampling
according to the Fourier spectrum of f; the FS subroutine was used in earlier
work of Bshouty and Jackson on quantum learning. Our results are as follows:
  - We give an algorithm for testing k-juntas to accuracy $\epsilon$ that uses
$O(k/\epsilon)$ quantum examples. This improves on the number of examples used
by the best known classical algorithm.
  - We establish the following lower bound: any FS-based k-junta testing
algorithm requires $\Omega(\sqrt{k})$ queries.
  - We give an algorithm for learning $k$-juntas to accuracy $\epsilon$ that
uses $O(\epsilon^{-1} k\log k)$ quantum examples and $O(2^k \log(1/\epsilon))$
random examples. We show that this learning algorithms is close to optimal by
giving a related lower bound.

A Bayesian Framework for Combining Valuation Estimates
2007-07-24

Yee,Kenton K.

Obtaining more accurate equity value estimates is the starting point for
stock selection, value-based indexing in a noisy market, and beating benchmark
indices through tactical style rotation. Unfortunately, discounted cash flow,
method of comparables, and fundamental analysis typically yield discrepant
valuation estimates. Moreover, the valuation estimates typically disagree with
market price. Can one form a superior valuation estimate by averaging over the
individual estimates, including market price? This article suggests a Bayesian
framework for combining two or more estimates into a superior valuation
estimate. The framework justifies the common practice of averaging over several
estimates to arrive at a final point estimate.

This paper describes the workspace and the inverse and direct kinematic
analysis of the VERNE machine, a serial/parallel 5-axis machine tool designed
by Fatronik for IRCCyN. This machine is composed of a three-degree-of-freedom
(DOF) parallel module and a two-DOF serial tilting table. The parallel module
consists of a moving platform that is connected to a fixed base by three
non-identical legs. This feature involves (i) a simultaneous combination of
rotation and translation for the moving platform, which is balanced by the
tilting table and (ii) workspace whose shape and volume vary as a function of
the tool length. This paper summarizes results obtained in the context of the
European projects NEXT ("Next Generation of Productions Systems").

The Kinetostatic Optimization of a Novel Prismatic Drive
2007-07-24

Chablat,Damien
Caro,Stéphane

The design of a mechanical transmission taking into account the transmitted
forces is reported in this paper. This transmission is based on Slide-o-Cam, a
cam mechanism with multiple rollers mounted on a common translating follower.
The design of Slide-o-Cam, a transmission intended to produce a sliding motion
from a turning drive, or vice versa, was reported elsewhere. This transmission
provides pure-rolling motion, thereby reducing the friction of rack-and-pinions
and linear drives. The pressure angle is a suitable performance index for this
transmission because it determines the amount of force transmitted to the load
vs. that transmitted to the machine frame. To assess the transmission
capability of the mechanism, the Hertz formula is introduced to calculate the
stresses on the rollers and on the cams. The final transmission is intended to
replace the current ball-screws in the Orthoglide, a three-DOF parallel robot
for the production of translational motions, currently under development for
machining applications at Ecole Centrale de Nantes.

Mumford dendrograms

Bradley,Patrick Erik

An effective $p$-adic encoding of dendrograms is presented through an
explicit embedding into the Bruhat-Tits tree for a $p$-adic number field. This
field depends on the number of children of a vertex and is a finite extension
of the field of $p$-adic numbers. It is shown that fixing $p$-adic
representatives of the residue field allows a natural way of encoding strings
by identifying a given alphabet with such representatives. A simple $p$-adic
hierarchic classification algorithm is derived for $p$-adic numbers, and is
applied to strings over finite alphabets. Examples of DNA coding are presented
and discussed. Finally, new geometric and combinatorial invariants of time
series of $p$-adic dendrograms are developped.

A Six Degree-Of-Freedom Haptic Device Based On The Orthoglide And A Hybrid Agile Eye

This paper is devoted to the kinematic design of a new six degree-of-freedom
haptic device using two parallel mechanisms. The first one, called orthoglide,
provides the translation motions and the second one, called agile eye, produces
the rotational motions. These two motions are decoupled to simplify the direct
and inverse kinematics, as it is needed for real-time control. To reduce the
inertial load, the motors are fixed on the base and a transmission with two
universal joints is used to transmit the rotational motions from the base to
the end-effector. Two alternative wrists are proposed (i), the agile eye with
three degrees of freedom or (ii) a hybrid wrist made by the assembly of a
two-dof agile eye with a rotary motor. The last one is optimized to increase
its stiffness and to decrease the number of moving parts.

A family of 3R orthogonal manipulators without offset on the third body can
be divided into exactly nine workspace topologies. The workspace is
characterized in a half-cross section by the singular curves. The workspace
topology is defined by the number of cusps and nodes that appear on these
singular curves. Based on this classification, we evaluate theses manipulators
by the condition number related to the joint space and the proportion of the
region with four inverse kinematic solutions compared to a sphere containing
all the workspace. This second performance number is in relation with the
workspace. We determine finally le topology of workspace to which belong
manipulators having the best performance number values.

the context of concurrent engineering. This leads us to draw a control
architecture enabling to drive virtual humans in a real-time immersed way, and
to interact with the product, through motion capture. Unfortunately, we show
this control scheme can lead to unfeasible movements because of the lack of
balance control. Introducing such a controller is a problem that was never
addressed in the context of real-time. We propose an implementation of a
balance controller, that we insert into the previously described control
scheme. Next section is dedicated to show the results we obtained. Finally, we
propose a virtual reality platform into which the digital character controller
is integrated.

Manufacturing is using Virtual Reality tools to enhance the product life
cycle. Their definitions are still in flux and it is necessary to define their

where we will find that, if the Virtual manufacturing concepts originate from
machining operations and evolve in this manufacturing area, there exist a lot
of applications in different fields such as casting, forging, sheet
metalworking and robotics (mechanisms). From the recent projects in Europe or
in USA, we notice that the human perception or the simulation of mannequin is
more and more needed in both fields. In this context, we have isolated some
applications as ergonomic studies, assembly and maintenance simulation, design
or training where the virtual reality tools can be applied. Thus, we find out a
family of applications where the virtual reality tools give the engineers the
main role in the optimization process. We will illustrate our paper by several
examples where virtual reality interfaces are used and combined with
optimization tools as multi-agent systems.

The effect of fading, channel inversion, and threshold scheduling on ad hoc networks
2007-07-24

Weber,Steven
Andrews,Jeffrey G.
Jindal,Nihar

This paper addresses three issues in the field of ad hoc network capacity:
the impact of i)channel fading, ii) channel inversion power control, and iii)
threshold-based scheduling on capacity. Channel inversion and threshold
scheduling may be viewed as simple ways to exploit channel state information
(CSI) without requiring cooperation across transmitters. We use the
transmission capacity (TC) as our metric, defined as the maximum spatial
intensity of successful simultaneous transmissions subject to a constraint on
the outage probability (OP). By assuming the nodes are located on the infinite
plane according to a Poisson process, we are able to employ tools from
stochastic geometry to obtain asymptotically tight bounds on the distribution
of the signal-to-interference (SIR) level, yielding in turn tight bounds on the
OP (relative to a given SIR threshold) and the TC. We demonstrate that in the
absence of CSI, fading can significantly reduce the TC and somewhat
surprisingly, channel inversion only makes matters worse. We develop a
threshold-based transmission rule where transmitters are active only if the
channel to their receiver is acceptably strong, obtain expressions for the
optimal threshold, and show that this simple, fully distributed scheme can
significantly reduce the effect of fading.

Semi-local string comparison: algorithmic techniques and applications
2007-07-24
2013-11-23
Tiskin,Alexander

A classical measure of string comparison is given by the longest common
subsequence (LCS) problem on a pair of strings. We consider its generalisation,
called the semi-local LCS problem, which arises naturally in many
string-related problems. The semi-local LCS problem asks for the LCS scores for
each of the input strings against every substring of the other input string,
and for every prefix of each input string against every suffix of the other
input string. Such a comparison pattern provides a much more detailed picture
of string similarity than a single LCS score; it also arises naturally in many
string-related problems. In fact, the semi-local LCS problem turns out to be
fundamental for string comparison, providing a powerful and flexible
alternative to classical dynamic programming. It is especially useful when the
input to a string comparison problem may not be available all at once: for
example, comparison of dynamically changing strings; comparison of compressed
strings; parallel string comparison. The same approach can also be applied to
permutation strings, providing efficient solutions for local versions of the
longest increasing subsequence (LIS) problem, and for the problem of computing
a maximum clique in a circle graph. Furthermore, the semi-local LCS problem
turns out to have surprising connections in a few seemingly unrelated fields,
such as computational geometry and algebra of semigroups. This work is devoted
to exploring the structure of the semi-local LCS problem, its efficient
solutions, and its applications in string comparison and other related areas,
including computational molecular biology.

Constant-degree graph expansions that preserve the treewidth
2007-07-24

Markov,Igor
Shi,Yaoyun

Many hard algorithmic problems dealing with graphs, circuits, formulas and
constraints admit polynomial-time upper bounds if the underlying graph has
small treewidth. The same problems often encourage reducing the maximal degree
of vertices to simplify theoretical arguments or address practical concerns.
Such degree reduction can be performed through a sequence of splittings of
vertices, resulting in an _expansion_ of the original graph. We observe that
the treewidth of a graph may increase dramatically if the splittings are not
performed carefully. In this context we address the following natural question:
is it possible to reduce the maximum degree to a constant without substantially
increasing the treewidth?
  Our work answers the above question affirmatively. We prove that any simple
undirected graph G=(V, E) admits an expansion G'=(V', E') with the maximum
degree <= 3 and treewidth(G') <= treewidth(G)+1. Furthermore, such an expansion
will have no more than 2|E|+|V| vertices and 3|E| edges; it can be computed
efficiently from a tree-decomposition of G. We also construct a family of
examples for which the increase by 1 in treewidth cannot be avoided.

Parallel kinematic mechanisms are interesting alternative designs for

two constant length struts gliding along fixed linear actuated joints with
different relative orientation. The comparative study is conducted on the basis
of a same prescribed Cartesian workspace for the three mechanisms. The common
desired workspace properties are a rectangular shape and given kinetostatic
performances. The machine size of each resulting design is used as a
comparative criterion. The 2-DOF machine mechanisms analyzed in this paper can
be extended to 3-axis machines by adding a third joint.

This paper describes a new parallel kinematic architecture for machining
applications: the orthoglide. This machine features three fixed parallel linear
joints which are mounted orthogonally and a mobile platform which moves in the

orthoglide is that it takes benefit from the advantages of the popular PPP
serial machines (regular Cartesian workspace shape and uniform performances) as
well as from the parallel kinematic arrangement of the links (less inertia and
better dynamic performances), which makes the orthoglide well suited to
high-speed machining applications. Possible extension of the orthoglide to
5-axis machining is also investigated.

Understanding the Characteristics of Internet Short Video Sharing: YouTube as a Case Study

Established in 2005, YouTube has become the most successful Internet site
providing a new generation of short video sharing service. Today, YouTube alone
comprises approximately 20% of all HTTP traffic, or nearly 10% of all traffic
on the Internet. Understanding the features of YouTube and similar video
sharing sites is thus crucial to their sustainable development and to network
traffic engineering. In this paper, using traces crawled in a 3-month period,
we present an in-depth and systematic measurement study on the characteristics
of YouTube videos. We find that YouTube videos have noticeably different
statistics compared to traditional streaming videos, ranging from length and
access pattern, to their active life span, ratings, and comments. The series of
datasets also allows us to identify the growth trend of this fast evolving
Internet site in various aspects, which has seldom been explored before. We
also look closely at the social networking aspect of YouTube, as this is a key
driving force toward its success. In particular, we find that the links to
related videos generated by uploaders' choices form a small-world network. This
suggests that the videos have strong correlations with each other, and creates
opportunities for developing novel caching or peer-to-peer distribution schemes
to efficiently deliver videos to end users.

Products of irreducible random matrices in the (Max,+) Algebra
2007-07-25

Mairesse,Jean

We consider the recursive equation ``x(n+1)=A(n)x(n)'' where x(n+1) and x(n)
are column vectors of size k and where A(n) is an irreducible random matrix of
size k x k. The matrix-vector multiplication in the (max,+) algebra is defined
by (A(n)x(n))_i= max_j [ A(n)_{ij} +x(n)_j ]. This type of equation can be used
to represent the evolution of Stochastic Event Graphs which include cyclic
Jackson Networks, some manufacturing models and models with general blocking
(such as Kanban). Let us assume that the sequence (A(n))_n is i.i.d or more
generally stationary and ergodic. The main result of the paper states that the
system couples in finite time with a unique stationary regime if and only if
there exists a set of matrices C such that P {A(0) in C} > 0, and the matrices
in C have a unique periodic regime.

The Computation of All 4R Serial Spherical Wrists With an Isotropic Architecture
2007-07-25

Chablat,Damien
Angeles,Jorge

A spherical wrist of the serial type is said to be isotropic if it can attain
a posture whereby the singular values of its Jacobian matrix are all identical
and nonzero. What isotropy brings about is robustness to manufacturing,
assembly, and measurement errors, thereby guaranteeing a maximum orientation
accuracy. In this paper we investigate the existence of redundant isotropic
architectures, which should add to the dexterity of the wrist under design by
virtue of its extra degree of freedom. The problem formulation leads to a
system of eight quadratic equations with eight unknowns. The Bezout number of
this system is thus 2^8 = 256, its BKK bound being 192. However, the actual
number of solutions is shown to be 32. We list all solutions of the foregoing
algebraic problem. All these solutions are real, but distinct solutions do not
necessarily lead to distinct manipulators. Upon discarding those algebraic
solutions that yield no new wrists, we end up with exactly eight distinct
architectures, the eight corresponding manipulators being displayed at their
isotropic posture.

GCP: Gossip-based Code Propagation for Large-scale Mobile Wireless Sensor Networks
2007-07-25

Busnel,Yann

Fleury,Eric
Kermarrec,Anne-Marie

Wireless sensor networks (WSN) have recently received an increasing interest.
They are now expected to be deployed for long periods of time, thus requiring
software updates. Updating the software code automatically on a huge number of
sensors is a tremendous task, as ''by hand'' updates can obviously not be
considered, especially when all participating sensors are embedded on mobile
entities. In this paper, we investigate an approach to automatically update
software in mobile sensor-based application when no localization mechanism is
available. We leverage the peer-to-peer cooperation paradigm to achieve a good
trade-off between reliability and scalability of code propagation. More
specifically, we present the design and evaluation of GCP ({\emph Gossip-based
Code Propagation}), a distributed software update algorithm for mobile wireless
sensor networks. GCP relies on two different mechanisms (piggy-backing and
forwarding control) to improve significantly the load balance without
sacrificing on the propagation speed. We compare GCP against traditional
dissemination approaches. Simulation results based on both synthetic and
realistic workloads show that GCP achieves a good convergence speed while
balancing the load evenly between sensors.

and we show here that Wang's New CRT I is a rewriting of an algorithm

The fold recognition methods are promissing tools for capturing the structure
of a protein by its amino acid residues sequence but their use is still
restricted by the needs of huge computational resources and suitable efficient
algorithms as well. In the recent version of FROST (Fold Recognition Oriented
Search Tool) package the most efficient algorithm for solving the Protein
Threading Problem (PTP) is implemented due to the strong collaboration between
the SYMBIOSE group in IRISA and MIG in Jouy-en-Josas. In this paper, we present
the diverse components of FROST, emphasizing on the recent advances in
formulating and solving new versions of the PTP and on the way of solving on a
computer cluster a million of instances in a easonable time.

Bijective Faithful Translations among Default Logics
2007-07-25
2007-07-30
Liberatore,Paolo

In this article, we study translations between variants of defaults logics
such that the extensions of the theories that are the input and the output of
the translation are in a bijective correspondence. We assume that a translation
can introduce new variables and that the result of translating a theory can
either be produced in time polynomial in the size of the theory or its output
is polynomial in that size; we however restrict to the case in which the
original theory has extensions. This study fills a gap between two previous
pieces of work, one studying bijective translations among restrictions of
default logics, and the other one studying non-bijective translations between
default logics variants.

Interactive Small-Step Algorithms I: Axiomatization

In earlier work, the Abstract State Machine Thesis -- that arbitrary

established for several classes of algorithms, including ordinary, interactive,
small-step algorithms. This was accomplished on the basis of axiomatizations of
these classes of algorithms. Here we extend the axiomatization and, in a
companion paper, the proof, to cover interactive small-step algorithms that are
not necessarily ordinary. This means that the algorithms (1) can complete a
step without necessarily waiting for replies to all queries from that step and
(2) can use not only the environment's replies but also the order in which the
replies were received.

but also the order in which the replies were received. In order to prove the
thesis for algorithms of this generality, we extend here the definition of
abstract state machines to incorporate explicit attention to the relative
timing of replies and to the possible absence of replies. We prove the
characterization theorem for extended abstract state machines with respect to
general algorithms as axiomatized in Part I.

How to be correct, lazy and efficient ?
2007-07-25

Recanati,Catherine

This paper is an introduction to Lambdix, a lazy Lisp interpreter implemented
at the Research Laboratory of Paris XI University (Laboratoire de Recherche en
Informatique, Orsay). Lambdix was devised in the course of an investigation
into the relationship between the semantics of programming languages and their
implementation; it was used to demonstrate that in the Lisp domain, semantic
correctness is consistent with efficiency, contrary to what has often been
claimed. The first part of the paper is an overview of well-known semantic
difficulties encountered by Lisp as well as an informal presentation of
Lambdix; it is shown that the difficulties which Lisp encouters do not arise in
Lambdix. The second part is about efficiency in implementation models. It
explains why Lambdix is better suited for lazy evaluation than previous models.
The section ends by giving comparative execution time tables.

Plotkin construction: rank and kernel
2007-07-26

Borges,Joaquim
Fernandez,Cristina

Given two binary codes of length n, using Plotkin construction we obtain a
code of length 2n. The construction works for linear and nonlinear codes. For
the linear case, it is straightforward to see that the dimension of the final
code is the sum of the dimensions of the starting codes. For nonlinear codes,
the rank and the dimension of the kernel are standard mesures of linearity. In
this report, we prove that both parameters are also the sum of the
corresponding ones of the starting codes.

Use of a $d$-Constraint During LDPC Decoding in a Bliss Scheme
2007-07-26

Hekstra,Andries P.

Bliss schemes of a run length limited (RLL) codec in combination with an LDPC
codec, generate LDPC parity bits over a systematic sequence of RLL channel bits
that are inherently redundant as they satisfy e.g. a $d=1$ minimum run length
constraint. That is the subsequences consisting of runs of length $d=1$, viz.
$...010...$ and $...101...$, cannot occur. We propose to use this redundancy
during LDPC decoding in a Bliss scheme by introducing additional $d$-constraint
nodes in the factor graph used by the LDPC decoder. The messages sent from
these new nodes to the variable or codeword bit nodes exert a ``force'' on the
resulting soft-bit vector coming out of the LDPC decoding that give it a
tendency to comply with the $d$-constraints. This way, we can significantly
reduce the probability of decoding error.

Closed form solutions for symmetric water filling games
2007-07-26
2007-07-30
Altman,Eitan
Avrachenkov,Konstantin
Garnaev,Andrey

We study power control in optimization and game frameworks. In the
optimization framework there is a single decision maker who assigns network
resources and in the game framework users share the network resources according
to Nash equilibrium. The solution of these problems is based on so-called
water-filling technique, which in turn uses bisection method for solution of
non-linear equations for Lagrange multiplies. Here we provide a closed form
solution to the water-filling problem, which allows us to solve it in a finite
number of operations. Also, we produce a closed form solution for the Nash
equilibrium in symmetric Gaussian interference game with an arbitrary number of
users. Even though the game is symmetric, there is an intrinsic hierarchical
structure induced by the quantity of the resources available to the users. We
use this hierarchical structure to perform a successive reduction of the game.
In addition, to its mathematical beauty, the explicit solution allows one to
study limiting cases when the crosstalk coefficient is either small or large.
We provide an alternative simple proof of the convergence of the Iterative
Water Filling Algorithm. Furthermore, it turns out that the convergence of
Iterative Water Filling Algorithm slows down when the crosstalk coefficient is
large. Using the closed form solution, we can avoid this problem. Finally, we
compare the non-cooperative approach with the cooperative approach and show
that the non-cooperative approach results in a more fair resource distribution.

Four-Group Decodable Space-Time Block Codes
2007-07-26

Dao,Dung Ngoc
Yuen,Chau
Tellambura,Chintha
Guan,Yong Liang
Tjhung,Tjeng Thiang

Two new rate-one full-diversity space-time block codes (STBC) are proposed.
They are characterized by the \emph{lowest decoding complexity} among the known
rate-one STBC, arising due to the complete separability of the transmitted
symbols into four groups for maximum likelihood detection. The first and the
second codes are delay-optimal if the number of transmit antennas is a power of
2 and even, respectively. The exact pair-wise error probability is derived to
allow for the performance optimization of the two codes. Compared with existing
low-decoding complexity STBC, the two new codes offer several advantages such
as higher code rate, lower encoding/decoding delay and complexity, lower
peak-to-average power ratio, and better performance.

Learning Probabilistic Models of Word Sense Disambiguation

This dissertation presents several new methods of supervised and unsupervised
learning of word sense disambiguation models. The supervised methods focus on
performing model searches through a space of probabilistic models, and the
unsupervised methods rely on the use of Gibbs Sampling and the Expectation

Naive Bayesian model is found to perform well. An explanation for this success
is presented in terms of learning rates and bias-variance decompositions.

Clifford Algebra of the Vector Space of Conics for decision boundary Hyperplanes in m-Euclidean Space
2007-07-26

Nieto,Isidro B.
Vallejo,J. Refugio

In this paper we embed $m$-dimensional Euclidean space in the geometric
algebra $Cl_m $ to extend the operators of incidence in ${R^m}$ to operators of
incidence in the geometric algebra to generalize the notion of separator to a
decision boundary hyperconic in the Clifford algebra of hyperconic sections
denoted as ${Cl}({Co}_{2})$. This allows us to extend the concept of a linear
perceptron or the spherical perceptron in conformal geometry and introduce the
more general conic perceptron, namely the {elliptical perceptron}. Using
Clifford duality a vector orthogonal to the decision boundary hyperplane is
determined. Experimental results are shown in 2-dimensional Euclidean space
where we separate data that are naturally separated by some typical plane conic
separators by this procedure. This procedure is more general in the sense that
it is independent of the dimension of the input data and hence we can speak of
the hyperconic elliptic perceptron.

A hash function is constructed based on a three-layer neural network. The
three neuron-layers are used to realize data confusion, diffusion and
compression respectively, and the multi-block hash mode is presented to support
the plaintext with variable length. Theoretical analysis and experimental
results show that this hash function is one-way, with high key sensitivity and
plaintext sensitivity, and secure against birthday attacks or
meet-in-the-middle attacks. Additionally, the neural network's property makes
it practical to realize in a parallel way. These properties make it a suitable
choice for data signature or authentication.

Consider the single server queue with an infinite buffer and a FIFO
discipline, either of type M/M/1 or Geom/Geom/1. Denote by A the arrival
process and by s the services. Assume the stability condition to be satisfied.
Denote by D the departure process in equilibrium and by r the time spent by the
customers at the very back of the queue. We prove that (D,r) has the same law
as (A,s) which is an extension of the classical Burke Theorem. In fact, r can
be viewed as the departures from a dual storage model. This duality between the
two models also appears when studying the transient behavior of a tandem by
means of the RSK algorithm: the first and last row of the resulting
semi-standard Young tableau are respectively the last instant of departure in
the queue and the total number of departures in the store.

of beginning of services is not Poisson. We then proceed to a more precise

Dyck paths of length 2n and we show that they provide the correlation function
of the successive services in a busy period with (n+1) customers.

Multiuser Successive Refinement and Multiple Description Coding
2007-07-27
2007-11-13
Tian,Chao
Chen,Jun
Diggavi,Suhas

We consider the multiuser successive refinement (MSR) problem, where the
users are connected to a central server via links with different noiseless
capacities, and each user wishes to reconstruct in a successive-refinement
fashion. An achievable region is given for the two-user two-layer case and it
provides the complete rate-distortion region for the Gaussian source under the
MSE distortion measure. The key observation is that this problem includes the
multiple description (MD) problem (with two descriptions) as a subsystem, and
the techniques useful in the MD problem can be extended to this case. We show
that the coding scheme based on the universality of random binning is
sub-optimal, because multiple Gaussian side informations only at the decoders
do incur performance loss, in contrast to the case of single side information
at the decoder. We further show that unlike the single user case, when there
are multiple users, the loss of performance by a multistage coding approach can
be unbounded for the Gaussian source. The result suggests that in such a
setting, the benefit of using successive refinement is not likely to justify
the accompanying performance loss. The MSR problem is also related to the
source coding problem where each decoder has its individual side information,
while the encoder has the complete set of the side informations. The MSR
problem further includes several variations of the MD problem, for which the
specialization of the general result is investigated and the implication is
discussed.

Parsimony Principles for Software Components and Metalanguages
2007-07-27

Veldhuizen,Todd L.

Software is a communication system. The usual topic of communication is
program behavior, as encoded by programs. Domain-specific libraries are
codebooks, domain-specific languages are coding schemes, and so forth. To turn
metaphor into method, we adapt toolsfrom information theory--the study of
efficient communication--to probe the efficiency with which languages and
libraries let us communicate programs. In previous work we developed an
information-theoretic analysis of software reuse in problem domains. This new
paper uses information theory to analyze tradeoffs in the design of components,
generators, and metalanguages. We seek answers to two questions: (1) How can we
judge whether a component is over- or under-generalized? Drawing on minimum
description length principles, we propose that the best component yields the
most succinct representation of the use cases. (2) If we view a programming
language as an assemblage of metalanguages, each providing a complementary
style of abstraction, how can these metalanguages aid or hinder us in
efficiently describing software? We describe a complex triangle of interactions
between the power of an abstraction mechanism, the amount of reuse it enables,
and the cognitive difficulty of its use.

Complexity of Propositional Proofs under a Promise
2007-07-28

Dershowitz,Nachum

We study -- within the framework of propositional proof complexity -- the
problem of certifying unsatisfiability of CNF formulas under the promise that
any satisfiable formula has many satisfying assignments, where ``many'' stands
for an explicitly specified function $\Lam$ in the number of variables $n$. To
this end, we develop propositional proof systems under different measures of
promises (that is, different $\Lam$) as extensions of resolution. This is done
by augmenting resolution with axioms that, roughly, can eliminate sets of truth
assignments defined by Boolean circuits. We then investigate the complexity of
such systems, obtaining an exponential separation in the average-case between
resolution under different size promises:
  1. Resolution has polynomial-size refutations for all unsatisfiable 3CNF
formulas when the promise is $\eps\cd2^n$, for any constant $0<\eps<1$.
  2. There are no sub-exponential size resolution refutations for random 3CNF
formulas, when the promise is $2^{\delta n}$ (and the number of clauses is
$o(n^{3/2})$), for any constant $0<\delta<1$.

Lopez,M. A.
Reisner,S.

The problem of the existence of an equi-partition of a curve in $\R^n$ has
recently been raised in the context of computational geometry. The problem is
to show that for a (continuous) curve $\Gamma : [0,1] \to \R^n$ and for any
positive integer N, there exist points $t_0=0<t_1<...<t_{N-1}<1=t_N$, such that
$d(\Gamma(t_{i-1}),\Gamma(t_i))=d(\Gamma(t_{i}),\Gamma(t_{i+1}))$ for all
$i=1,...,N$, where d is a metric or even a semi-metric (a weaker notion) on
$\R^n$. We show here that the existence of such points, in a broader context,
is a consequence of Brower's fixed point theorem.

Spatial Aggregation: Data Model and Implementation

Data aggregation in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) is only marginally
present in commercial systems nowadays, mostly through ad-hoc solutions. In
this paper, we first present a formal model for representing spatial data. This
model integrates geographic data and information contained in data warehouses
external to the GIS. We define the notion of geometric aggregation, a general
framework for aggregate queries in a GIS setting. We also identify the class of
summable queries, which can be efficiently evaluated by precomputing the
overlay of two or more of the thematic layers involved in the query. We also
sketch a language, denoted GISOLAP-QL, for expressing queries that involve GIS
and OLAP features. In addition, we introduce Piet, an implementation of our
proposal, that makes use of overlay precomputation for answering spatial
queries (aggregate or not). Our experimental evaluation showed that for a
certain class of geometric queries with or without aggregation, overlay
precomputation outperforms R-tree-based techniques. Finally, as a particular
application of our proposal, we study topological queries.

Embedded Rank Distance Codes for ISI channels
2007-07-29

Dusad,S.
Diggavi,S. N.
Calderbank,A. R.

Designs for transmit alphabet constrained space-time codes naturally lead to
questions about the design of rank distance codes. Recently, diversity embedded
multi-level space-time codes for flat fading channels have been designed from
sets of binary matrices with rank distance guarantees over the binary field by
mapping them onto QAM and PSK constellations. In this paper we demonstrate that
diversity embedded space-time codes for fading Inter-Symbol Interference (ISI)
channels can be designed with provable rank distance guarantees. As a corollary
we obtain an asymptotic characterization of the fixed transmit alphabet
rate-diversity trade-off for multiple antenna fading ISI channels. The key idea
is to construct and analyze properties of binary matrices with a particular
structure induced by ISI channels.

We develop a framework for linear-programming (LP) decoding of non-binary
linear codes over rings. We prove that the resulting LP decoder has the
`maximum likelihood certificate' property, and we show that the decoder output
is the lowest cost pseudocodeword. Equivalence between pseudocodewords of the
linear program and pseudocodewords of graph covers is proved. LP decoding
performance is illustrated for the (11,6,5) ternary Golay code with ternary PSK
modulation over AWGN, and in this case it is shown that the LP decoder
performance is comparable to codeword-error-rate-optimum hard-decision based
decoding.

Blocking a transition in a Free Choice net and what it tells about its throughput

Gaujal,Bruno

In a live and bounded Free Choice Petri net, pick a non-conflicting
transition. Then there exists a unique reachable marking in which no transition
is enabled except the selected one. For a routed live and bounded Free Choice
net, this property is true for any transition of the net. Consider now a live
and bounded stochastic routed Free Choice net, and assume that the routings and
the firing times are independent and identically distributed. Using the above
results, we prove the existence of asymptotic firing throughputs for all
transitions in the net. Furthermore the vector of the throughputs at the
different transitions is explicitly computable up to a multiplicative constant.

Separation Logic for Small-step Cminor

Appel,Andrew W.
Blazy,Sandrine

Cminor is a mid-level imperative programming language; there are
proved-correct optimizing compilers from C to Cminor and from Cminor to machine
language. We have redesigned Cminor so that it is suitable for Hoare Logic
reasoning and we have designed a Separation Logic for Cminor. In this paper, we
give a small-step semantics (instead of the big-step of the proved-correct
compiler) that is motivated by the need to support future concurrent
extensions. We detail a machine-checked proof of soundness of our Separation
Logic. This is the first large-scale machine-checked proof of a Separation
Logic w.r.t. a small-step semantics. The work presented in this paper has been
carried out in the Coq proof assistant. It is a first step towards an
environment in which concurrent Cminor programs can be verified using
Separation Logic and also compiled by a proved-correct compiler with formal
end-to-end correctness guarantees.

On sparse representations of linear operators and the approximation of matrix products
2007-07-30
2009-06-26
Belabbas,Mohamed-Ali
Wolfe,Patrick J.

Thus far, sparse representations have been exploited largely in the context
of robustly estimating functions in a noisy environment from a few
measurements. In this context, the existence of a basis in which the signal
class under consideration is sparse is used to decrease the number of necessary
measurements while controlling the approximation error. In this paper, we
instead focus on applications in numerical analysis, by way of sparse
representations of linear operators with the objective of minimizing the number
of operations needed to perform basic operations (here, multiplication) on
these operators. We represent a linear operator by a sum of rank-one operators,
and show how a sparse representation that guarantees a low approximation error
for the product can be obtained from analyzing an induced quadratic form. This
construction in turn yields new algorithms for computing approximate matrix
products.

Competitive minimax universal decoding for several ensembles of random codes
2007-07-30

Akirav,Yaniv
Merhav,Neri

Universally achievable error exponents pertaining to certain families of
channels (most notably, discrete memoryless channels (DMC's)), and various
ensembles of random codes, are studied by combining the competitive minimax
approach, proposed by Feder and Merhav, with Chernoff bound and Gallager's
techniques for the analysis of error exponents. In particular, we derive a
single--letter expression for the largest, universally achievable fraction
$\xi$ of the optimum error exponent pertaining to the optimum ML decoding.
Moreover, a simpler single--letter expression for a lower bound to $\xi$ is
presented. To demonstrate the tightness of this lower bound, we use it to show
that $\xi=1$, for the binary symmetric channel (BSC), when the random coding
distribution is uniform over: (i) all codes (of a given rate), and (ii) all
linear codes, in agreement with well--known results. We also show that $\xi=1$
for the uniform ensemble of systematic linear codes, and for that of
time--varying convolutional codes in the bit-error--rate sense. For the latter
case, we also show how the corresponding universal decoder can be efficiently
implemented using a slightly modified version of the Viterbi algorithm which em
employs two trellises.

On Throughput Scaling of Wireless Networks: Effect of Node Density and Propagation Model
2007-07-30

Duarte-Melo,Enrique J.
Josan,Awlok
Liu,Mingyan
Neuhoff,David L.
Pradhan,Sandeep

This paper derives a lower bound to the per-node throughput achievable by a
wireless network when n source-destination pairs are randomly distributed
throughout a disk of radius $n^\gamma$, $ \gamma \geq 0$, propagation is
modeled by attenuation of the form $1/(1+d)^\alpha$, $\alpha >2$, and
successful transmission occurs at a fixed rate W when received signal to noise
and interference ratio is greater than some threshold $\beta$, and at rate 0
otherwise. The lower bound has the form $n^{1-\gamma}$ when $\gamma < 1/2$, and
$(n \ln n)^{-1/2}$ when $\gamma \geq 1/2$. The methods are similar to, but
somewhat simpler than, those in the seminal paper by Gupta and Kumar.

Image Authentication Based on Neural Networks
2007-07-30

Lian,Shiguo

Neural network has been attracting more and more researchers since the past
decades. The properties, such as parameter sensitivity, random similarity,
learning ability, etc., make it suitable for information protection, such as
data encryption, data authentication, intrusion detection, etc. In this paper,
by investigating neural networks' properties, the low-cost authentication
method based on neural networks is proposed and used to authenticate images or
videos. The authentication method can detect whether the images or videos are
modified maliciously. Firstly, this chapter introduces neural networks'
properties, such as parameter sensitivity, random similarity, diffusion
property, confusion property, one-way property, etc. Secondly, the chapter
gives an introduction to neural network based protection methods. Thirdly, an
image or video authentication scheme based on neural networks is presented, and
its performances, including security, robustness and efficiency, are analyzed.
Finally, conclusions are drawn, and some open issues in this field are
presented.

On the Complexity of the Interlace Polynomial
2007-07-31
2008-04-16
Bläser,Markus
Hoffmann,Christian

We consider the two-variable interlace polynomial introduced by Arratia,
Bollobas and Sorkin (2004). We develop graph transformations which allow us to
derive point-to-point reductions for the interlace polynomial. Exploiting these
reductions we obtain new results concerning the computational complexity of
evaluating the interlace polynomial at a fixed point. Regarding exact
evaluation, we prove that the interlace polynomial is #P-hard to evaluate at
every point of the plane, except on one line, where it is trivially polynomial
time computable, and four lines, where the complexity is still open. This
solves a problem posed by Arratia, Bollobas and Sorkin (2004). In particular,
three specializations of the two-variable interlace polynomial, the
vertex-nullity interlace polynomial, the vertex-rank interlace polynomial and
the independent set polynomial, are almost everywhere #P-hard to evaluate, too.
For the independent set polynomial, our reductions allow us to prove that it is
even hard to approximate at any point except at 0.

Note on edge-colored graphs and digraphs without properly colored cycles
2007-07-31

Gutin,Gregory

We study the following two functions: d(n,c) and $\vec{d}(n,c)$; d(n,c)
($\vec{d}(n,c)$) is the minimum number k such that every c-edge-colored
undirected (directed) graph of order n and minimum monochromatic degree
(out-degree) at least k has a properly colored cycle. Abouelaoualim et al.
(2007) stated a conjecture which implies that d(n,c)=1. Using a recursive
construction of c-edge-colored graphs with minimum monochromatic degree p and
without properly colored cycles, we show that $d(n,c)\ge {1 \over c}(\log_cn
-\log_c\log_cn)$ and, thus, the conjecture does not hold. In particular, this
inequality significantly improves a lower bound on $\vec{d}(n,2)$ obtained by
Gutin, Sudakov and Yeo in 1998.

Side-information Scalable Source Coding
2007-07-31

Tian,Chao
Diggavi,Suhas N.

The problem of side-information scalable (SI-scalable) source coding is
considered in this work, where the encoder constructs a progressive
description, such that the receiver with high quality side information will be
able to truncate the bitstream and reconstruct in the rate distortion sense,
while the receiver with low quality side information will have to receive
further data in order to decode. We provide inner and outer bounds for general
discrete memoryless sources. The achievable region is shown to be tight for the
case that either of the decoders requires a lossless reconstruction, as well as
the case with degraded deterministic distortion measures. Furthermore we show
that the gap between the achievable region and the outer bounds can be bounded
by a constant when square error distortion measure is used. The notion of
perfectly scalable coding is introduced as both the stages operate on the
Wyner-Ziv bound, and necessary and sufficient conditions are given for sources
satisfying a mild support condition. Using SI-scalable coding and successive
refinement Wyner-Ziv coding as basic building blocks, a complete
characterization is provided for the important quadratic Gaussian source with
multiple jointly Gaussian side-informations, where the side information quality
does not have to be monotonic along the scalable coding order. Partial result
is provided for the doubly symmetric binary source with Hamming distortion when
the worse side information is a constant, for which one of the outer bound is
strictly tighter than the other one.

Comments on the Reliability of Lawson and Hanson's Linear Distance Programming Algorithm: Subroutine LDP

This brief paper: (1) Discusses strategies to generate random test cases that
can be used to extensively test any Linear Distance Program (LDP) software. (2)
Gives three numerical examples of input cases generated by this strategy that
cause problems in the Lawson and Hanson LDP module. (3) Proposes, as a standard
matter of acceptable implementation procedures, that (unless it is done
internally in the software itself, but, in general, this seems to be much rarer
than one would expect) all users should test the returned output from any LDP
module for self-consistency since it incurs only a small amount of added
computational overhead and it is not hard to do.

Communication under Strong Asynchronism
2007-07-31

Tchamkerten,Aslan
Chandar,Venkat
Wornell,Gregory

We consider asynchronous communication over point-to-point discrete
memoryless channels. The transmitter starts sending one block codeword at an
instant that is uniformly distributed within a certain time period, which
represents the level of asynchronism. The receiver, by means of a sequential
decoder, must isolate the message without knowing when the codeword
transmission starts but being cognizant of the asynchronism level A. We are
interested in how quickly can the receiver isolate the sent message,
particularly in the regime where A is exponentially larger than the codeword
length N, which we refer to as `strong asynchronism.'
  This model of sparse communication may represent the situation of a sensor
that remains idle most of the time and, only occasionally, transmits
information to a remote base station which needs to quickly take action.
  The first result shows that vanishing error probability can be guaranteed as
N tends to infinity while A grows as Exp(N*k) if and only if k does not exceed
the `synchronization threshold,' a constant that admits a simple closed form
expression, and is at least as large as the capacity of the synchronized
channel. The second result is the characterization of a set of achievable
strictly positive rates in the regime where A is exponential in N, and where
the rate is defined with respect to the expected delay between the time
information starts being emitted until the time the receiver makes a decision.
  As an application of the first result we consider antipodal signaling over a
Gaussian channel and derive a simple necessary condition between A, N, and SNR
for achieving reliable communication.

Djokovic,Dragomir Z.

Let PCS_p^N denote a set of p binary sequences of length N such that the sum
of their periodic auto-correlation functions is a delta-function. In the 1990,
Boemer and Antweiler addressed the problem of constructing such sequences. They
presented a table covering the range p <= 12, N <= 50 and showing in which
cases it was known at that time whether such sequences exist, do not exist, or
the question of existence is undecided. The number of undecided cases was
rather large.
  Subsequently the number of undecided cases was reduced to 26 by the author.
In the present note, several cyclic difference families are constructed and
used to obtain new sets of periodic binary sequences. Thereby the original
problem of Boemer and Antweiler is completely solved.

Virtual screening with support vector machines and structure kernels
2007-08-01

Mahé,Pierre
Vert,Jean-Philippe

Support vector machines and kernel methods have recently gained considerable
attention in chemoinformatics. They offer generally good performance for
problems of supervised classification or regression, and provide a flexible and
computationally efficient framework to include relevant information and prior
knowledge about the data and problems to be handled. In particular, with kernel
methods molecules do not need to be represented and stored explicitly as
vectors or fingerprints, but only to be compared to each other through a
comparison function technically called a kernel. While classical kernels can be
used to compare vector or fingerprint representations of molecules, completely
new kernels were developed in the recent years to directly compare the 2D or 3D
structures of molecules, without the need for an explicit vectorization step
through the extraction of molecular descriptors. While still in their infancy,
these approaches have already demonstrated their relevance on several toxicity
prediction and structure-activity relationship problems.

De Vrijer has presented a proof of the finite developments theorem which, in
addition to showing that all developments are finite, gives an effective
reduction strategy computing longest developments as well as a simple formula
computing their length.
  We show that by applying a rather simple and intuitive principle of duality
to de Vrijer's approach one arrives at a proof that some developments are
finite which in addition yields an effective reduction strategy computing
shortest developments as well as a simple formula computing their length. The
duality fails for general beta-reduction.

Multisource Bayesian sequential change detection
2007-08-01
2008-04-01
Dayanik,Savas
Poor,H. Vincent
Sezer,Semih O.

Suppose that local characteristics of several independent compound Poisson
and Wiener processes change suddenly and simultaneously at some unobservable
disorder time. The problem is to detect the disorder time as quickly as
possible after it happens and minimize the rate of false alarms at the same
time. These problems arise, for example, from managing product quality in
manufacturing systems and preventing the spread of infectious diseases. The
promptness and accuracy of detection rules improve greatly if multiple
independent information sources are available. Earlier work on sequential
change detection in continuous time does not provide optimal rules for
situations in which several marked count data and continuously changing signals
are simultaneously observable. In this paper, optimal Bayesian sequential
detection rules are developed for such problems when the marked count data is
in the form of independent compound Poisson processes, and the continuously
changing signals form a multi-dimensional Wiener process. An auxiliary optimal
stopping problem for a jump-diffusion process is solved by transforming it
first into a sequence of optimal stopping problems for a pure diffusion by
means of a jump operator. This method is new and can be very useful in other
applications as well, because it allows the use of the powerful optimal
stopping theory for diffusions.

Distributing the Kalman Filter for Large-Scale Systems
2007-08-01
2008-02-25
Khan,Usman A.
Moura,Jose M. F.

This paper derives a \emph{distributed} Kalman filter to estimate a sparsely
connected, large-scale, $n-$dimensional, dynamical system monitored by a
network of $N$ sensors. Local Kalman filters are implemented on the
($n_l-$dimensional, where $n_l\ll n$) sub-systems that are obtained after
spatially decomposing the large-scale system. The resulting sub-systems
overlap, which along with an assimilation procedure on the local Kalman
filters, preserve an $L$th order Gauss-Markovian structure of the centralized
error processes. The information loss due to the $L$th order Gauss-Markovian
approximation is controllable as it can be characterized by a divergence that
decreases as $L\uparrow$. The order of the approximation, $L$, leads to a lower
bound on the dimension of the sub-systems, hence, providing a criterion for
sub-system selection. The assimilation procedure is carried out on the local
error covariances with a distributed iterate collapse inversion (DICI)
algorithm that we introduce. The DICI algorithm computes the (approximated)
centralized Riccati and Lyapunov equations iteratively with only local
communication and low-order computation. We fuse the observations that are
common among the local Kalman filters using bipartite fusion graphs and
consensus averaging algorithms. The proposed algorithm achieves full
distribution of the Kalman filter that is coherent with the centralized Kalman
filter with an $L$th order Gaussian-Markovian structure on the centralized
error processes. Nowhere storage, communication, or computation of
$n-$dimensional vectors and matrices is needed; only $n_l \ll n$ dimensional
vectors and matrices are communicated or used in the computation at the
sensors.

Capacity Region of the Finite-State Multiple Access Channel with and without Feedback
2007-08-02

Permuter,Haim
Weissman,Tsachy

The capacity region of the Finite-State Multiple Access Channel (FS-MAC) with
feedback that may be an arbitrary time-invariant function of the channel output
samples is considered. We characterize both an inner and an outer bound for
this region, using Masseys's directed information. These bounds are shown to
coincide, and hence yield the capacity region, of FS-MACs where the state
process is stationary and ergodic and not affected by the inputs.
  Though `multi-letter' in general, our results yield explicit conclusions when
applied to specific scenarios of interest. E.g., our results allow us to:
  - Identify a large class of FS-MACs, that includes the additive mod-2 noise
MAC where the noise may have memory, for which feedback does not enlarge the
capacity region.
  - Deduce that, for a general FS-MAC with states that are not affected by the
input, if the capacity (region) without feedback is zero, then so is the
capacity (region) with feedback.
  - Deduce that the capacity region of a MAC that can be decomposed into a
`multiplexer' concatenated by a point-to-point channel (with, without, or with
partial feedback), the capacity region is given by $\sum_{m} R_m \leq C$, where
C is the capacity of the point to point channel and m indexes the encoders.
Moreover, we show that for this family of channels source-channel coding
separation holds.

Why the relational data model can be considered as a formal basis for group operations in object-oriented systems
2007-08-02

Grigoriev,Evgeniy

Relational data model defines a specification of a type "relation". However,
its simplicity does not mean that the system implementing this model must
operate with structures having the same simplicity. We consider two principles
allowing create a system which combines object-oriented paradigm (OOP) and
relational data model (RDM) in one framework. The first principle -- "complex
data in encapsulated domains" -- is well known from The Third Manifesto by Date
and Darwen. The second principle --"data complexity in names"-- is the basis
for a system where data are described as complex objects and uniquely
represented as a set of relations. Names of these relations and names of their
attributes are combinations of names entered in specifications of the complex
objects. Below, we consider the main properties of such a system.

Diversity of MIMO Multihop Relay Channels
2007-08-02

Yang,Sheng
Belfiore,Jean-Claude

We consider slow fading relay channels with a single multi-antenna
source-destination terminal pair. The source signal arrives at the destination
via N hops through N-1 layers of relays. We analyze the diversity of such
channels with fixed network size at high SNR. In the clustered case where the
relays within the same layer can have full cooperation, the cooperative
decode-and-forward (DF) scheme is shown to be optimal in terms of the
diversity-multiplexing tradeoff (DMT). The upper bound on the DMT, the cut-set
bound, is attained. In the non-clustered case, we show that the naive
amplify-and-forward (AF) scheme has the maximum multiplexing gain of the
channel but is suboptimal in diversity, as compared to the cut-set bound. To
improve the diversity, space-time relay processing is introduced through the
parallel partition of the multihop channel. The idea is to let the source
signal go through K different "AF paths" in the multihop channel. This parallel
AF scheme creates a parallel channel in the time domain and has the maximum
diversity if the partition is properly designed. Since this scheme does not
achieve the maximum multiplexing gain in general, we propose a flip-and-forward
(FF) scheme that is built from the parallel AF scheme. It is shown that the FF
scheme achieves both the maximum diversity and multiplexing gains in a
distributed multihop channel of arbitrary size. In order to realize the DMT
promised by the relaying strategies, approximately universal coding schemes are
also proposed.

A preliminary analysis on metaheuristics methods applied to the Haplotype Inference Problem
2007-08-03

Di Gaspero,Luca
Roli,Andrea

Haplotype Inference is a challenging problem in bioinformatics that consists
in inferring the basic genetic constitution of diploid organisms on the basis
of their genotype. This information allows researchers to perform association
studies for the genetic variants involved in diseases and the individual
responses to therapeutic agents.
  A notable approach to the problem is to encode it as a combinatorial problem
(under certain hypotheses, such as the pure parsimony criterion) and to solve
it using off-the-shelf combinatorial optimization techniques. The main methods
applied to Haplotype Inference are either simple greedy heuristic or exact
methods (Integer Linear Programming, Semidefinite Programming, SAT encoding)
that, at present, are adequate only for moderate size instances.
  We believe that metaheuristic and hybrid approaches could provide a better
scalability. Moreover, metaheuristics can be very easily combined with problem
specific heuristics and they can also be integrated with tree-based search
techniques, thus providing a promising framework for hybrid systems in which a
good trade-off between effectiveness and efficiency can be reached.
  In this paper we illustrate a feasibility study of the approach and discuss
some relevant design issues, such as modeling and design of approximate solvers
that combine constructive heuristics, local search-based improvement strategies
and learning mechanisms. Besides the relevance of the Haplotype Inference
problem itself, this preliminary analysis is also an interesting case study
because the formulation of the problem poses some challenges in modeling and
hybrid metaheuristic solver design that can be generalized to other problems.

Quasi-stationary distributions as centrality measures of reducible graphs

Avrachenkov,Konstantin
Borkar,Vivek
Nemirovsky,Danil

Random walk can be used as a centrality measure of a directed graph. However,
if the graph is reducible the random walk will be absorbed in some subset of
nodes and will never visit the rest of the graph. In Google PageRank the
problem was solved by introduction of uniform random jumps with some
probability. Up to the present, there is no clear criterion for the choice this
parameter. We propose to use parameter-free centrality measure which is based
on the notion of quasi-stationary distribution. Specifically we suggest four
quasi-stationary based centrality measures, analyze them and conclude that they
produce approximately the same ranking. The new centrality measures can be
applied in spam detection to detect ``link farms'' and in image search to find
photo albums.

Efficient Divide-and-Conquer Implementations Of Symmetric FSAs
2007-08-03

A deterministic finite-state automaton (FSA) is an abstract sequential
machine that reads the symbols comprising an input word one at a time. An FSA
is symmetric if its output is independent of the order in which the input
symbols are read, i.e., if the output is invariant under permutations of the
input. We show how to convert a symmetric FSA A into an automaton-like
divide-and-conquer process whose intermediate results are no larger than the
size of A's memory. In comparison, a similar result for general FSA's has been
long known via functional composition, but entails an exponential increase in
memory size. The new result has applications to parallel processing and
symmetric FSA networks.

Complementary algorithms for graphs and percolation
2007-08-03

Lee,Michael J.

A pair of complementary algorithms are presented. One of the pair is a fast
method for connecting graphs with an edge. The other is a fast method for
removing edges from a graph. Both algorithms employ the same tree based graph
representation and so, in concert, can arbitrarily modify any graph. Since the
clusters of a percolation model may be described as simple connected graphs, an
efficient Monte Carlo scheme can be constructed that uses the algorithms to
sweep the occupation probability back and forth between two turning points.
This approach concentrates computational sampling time within a region of
interest. A high precision value of pc = 0.59274603(9) was thus obtained, by
Mersenne twister, for the two dimensional square site percolation threshold.

Structure or Noise?
2007-08-04
2008-06-29
Still,Susanne
Crutchfield,James P.

We show how rate-distortion theory provides a mechanism for automated theory
building by naturally distinguishing between regularity and randomness. We
start from the simple principle that model variables should, as much as
possible, render the future and past conditionally independent. From this, we
construct an objective function for model making whose extrema embody the
trade-off between a model's structural complexity and its predictive power. The
solutions correspond to a hierarchy of models that, at each level of
complexity, achieve optimal predictive power at minimal cost. In the limit of
maximal prediction the resulting optimal model identifies a process's intrinsic
organization by extracting the underlying causal states. In this limit, the
model's complexity is given by the statistical complexity, which is known to be
minimal for achieving maximum prediction. Examples show how theory building can
profit from analyzing a process's causal compressibility, which is reflected in
the optimal models' rate-distortion curve--the process's characteristic for
optimally balancing structure and noise at different levels of representation.

has cycles, chains, bipartite graphs or product graphs as its subgraphs.

Reconstruction of Protein-Protein Interaction Pathways by Mining Subject-Verb-Objects Intermediates
2007-08-05

Ling,Maurice HT
Lefevre,Christophe
Nicholas,Kevin R.
Lin,Feng

The exponential increase in publication rate of new articles is limiting
access of researchers to relevant literature. This has prompted the use of text
mining tools to extract key biological information. Previous studies have
reported extensive modification of existing generic text processors to process
biological text. However, this requirement for modification had not been
examined. In this study, we have constructed Muscorian, using MontyLingua, a
generic text processor. It uses a two-layered generalization-specialization
paradigm previously proposed where text was generically processed to a suitable
intermediate format before domain-specific data extraction techniques are
applied at the specialization layer. Evaluation using a corpus and experts
indicated 86-90% precision and approximately 30% recall in extracting
protein-protein interactions, which was comparable to previous studies using
either specialized biological text processing tools or modified existing tools.
Our study had also demonstrated the flexibility of the two-layered
generalization-specialization paradigm by using the same generalization layer
for two specialized information extraction tasks.

Virtual Environments for Training: From Individual Learning to Collaboration with Humanoids
2007-08-06

Gerbaud,Stéphanie
Mollet,Nicolas
Arnaldi,Bruno

The next generation of virtual environments for training is oriented towards
collaborative aspects. Therefore, we have decided to enhance our platform for
virtual training environments, adding collaboration opportunities and
integrating humanoids. In this paper we put forward a model of humanoid that
suits both virtual humans and representations of real users, according to
collaborative training activities. We suggest adaptations to the scenario model
of our platform making it possible to write collaborative procedures. We
introduce a mechanism of action selection made up of a global repartition and
an individual choice. These models are currently being integrated and validated
in GVT, a virtual training tool for maintenance of military equipments,
developed in collaboration with the French company NEXTER-Group.

Characterising Web Site Link Structure
2007-08-06

Zhou,Shi
Cox,Ingemar
Petricek,Vaclav

The topological structures of the Internet and the Web have received
considerable attention. However, there has been little research on the
topological properties of individual web sites. In this paper, we consider
whether web sites (as opposed to the entire Web) exhibit structural
similarities. To do so, we exhaustively crawled 18 web sites as diverse as
governmental departments, commercial companies and university departments in
different countries. These web sites consisted of as little as a few thousand
pages to millions of pages. Statistical analysis of these 18 sites revealed
that the internal link structure of the web sites are significantly different
when measured with first and second-order topological properties, i.e.
properties based on the connectivity of an individual or a pairs of nodes.
However, examination of a third-order topological property that consider the
connectivity between three nodes that form a triangle, revealed a strong
correspondence across web sites, suggestive of an invariant. Comparison with
the Web, the AS Internet, and a citation network, showed that this third-order
property is not shared across other types of networks. Nor is the property
exhibited in generative network models such as that of Barabasi and Albert.

Cooperative Beamforming for Wireless Ad Hoc Networks
2007-08-06

Dong,Lun
Petropulu,Athina P.
Poor,H. Vincent

Via collaborative beamforming, nodes in a wireless network are able to
transmit a common message over long distances in an energy efficient fashion.
However, the process of making available the same message to all collaborating
nodes introduces delays. In this paper, a MAC-PHY cross-layer scheme is
proposed that enables collaborative beamforming at significantly reduced
collaboration overhead. It consists of two phases. In the first phase, nodes
transmit locally in a random access time-slotted fashion. Simultaneous
transmissions from multiple source nodes are viewed as linear mixtures of all
transmitted packets. In the second phase, a set of collaborating nodes, acting
as a distributed antenna system, beamform the received analog waveform to one
or more faraway destinations. This step requires multiplication of the received
analog waveform by a complex weight, which is independently computed by each
cooperating node, and which allows packets bound to the same destination to add
coherently at the destination node. Assuming that each node has access to
location information, the proposed scheme can achieve high throughput, which in
certain cases exceeds one. An analysis of the symbol error probability
corresponding to the proposed scheme is provided.

Cooperative game theory and the Gaussian interference channel

Leshem,Amir
Zehavi,Ephi

In this paper we discuss the use of cooperative game theory for analyzing
interference channels. We extend our previous work, to games with N players as
well as frequency selective channels and joint TDM/FDM strategies.
  We show that the Nash bargaining solution can be computed using convex
optimization techniques. We also show that the same results are applicable to
interference channels where only statistical knowledge of the channel is
available. Moreover, for the special case of two players $2\times K$ frequency
selective channel (with K frequency bins) we provide an $O(K \log_2 K)$
complexity algorithm for computing the Nash bargaining solution under mask
constraint and using joint FDM/TDM strategies. Simulation results are also
provided.

Relations between random coding exponents and the statistical physics of random codes
2007-08-06

Merhav,Neri

The partition function pertaining to finite--temperature decoding of a
(typical) randomly chosen code is known to have three types of behavior,
corresponding to three phases in the plane of rate vs. temperature: the {\it
ferromagnetic phase}, corresponding to correct decoding, the {\it paramagnetic
phase}, of complete disorder, which is dominated by exponentially many
incorrect codewords, and the {\it glassy phase} (or the condensed phase), where
the system is frozen at minimum energy and dominated by subexponentially many
incorrect codewords. We show that the statistical physics associated with the
two latter phases are intimately related to random coding exponents. In
particular, the exponent associated with the probability of correct decoding at
rates above capacity is directly related to the free energy in the glassy
phase, and the exponent associated with probability of error (the error
exponent) at rates below capacity, is strongly related to the free energy in
the paramagnetic phase. In fact, we derive alternative expressions of these
exponents in terms of the corresponding free energies, and make an attempt to
obtain some insights from these expressions. Finally, as a side result, we also
compare the phase diagram associated with a simple finite-temperature universal
decoder for discrete memoryless channels, to that of the finite--temperature
decoder that is aware of the channel statistics.

Permutation Decoding and the Stopping Redundancy Hierarchy of Cyclic and Extended Cyclic Codes
2007-08-07
2008-07-03
Hehn,Thorsten
Milenkovic,Olgica
Laendner,Stefan
Huber,Johannes B.

We introduce the notion of the stopping redundancy hierarchy of a linear
block code as a measure of the trade-off between performance and complexity of
iterative decoding for the binary erasure channel. We derive lower and upper
bounds for the stopping redundancy hierarchy via Lovasz's Local Lemma and
Bonferroni-type inequalities, and specialize them for codes with cyclic
parity-check matrices. Based on the observed properties of parity-check
matrices with good stopping redundancy characteristics, we develop a novel
decoding technique, termed automorphism group decoding, that combines iterative
message passing and permutation decoding. We also present bounds on the
smallest number of permutations of an automorphism group decoder needed to
correct any set of erasures up to a prescribed size. Simulation results
demonstrate that for a large number of algebraic codes, the performance of the
new decoding method is close to that of maximum likelihood decoding.

On the Self-stabilization of Mobile Robots in Graphs
2007-08-07
2007-08-08
Blin,Lélia
Potop-Butucaru,Maria Gradinariu
Tixeuil,Sébastien

Self-stabilization is a versatile technique to withstand any transient fault
in a distributed system. Mobile robots (or agents) are one of the emerging
trends in distributed computing as they mimic autonomous biologic entities. The
contribution of this paper is threefold. First, we present a new model for
studying mobile entities in networks subject to transient faults. Our model
differs from the classical robot model because robots have constraints about
the paths they are allowed to follow, and from the classical agent model
because the number of agents remains fixed throughout the execution of the
protocol. Second, in this model, we study the possibility of designing
self-stabilizing algorithms when those algorithms are run by mobile robots (or
agents) evolving on a graph. We concentrate on the core building blocks of
robot and agents problems: naming and leader election. Not surprisingly, when
no constraints are given on the network graph topology and local execution
model, both problems are impossible to solve. Finally, using minimal hypothesis
with respect to impossibility results, we provide deterministic and
probabilistic solutions to both problems, and show equivalence of these
problems by an algorithmic reduction mechanism.

Modeling Visual Information Processing in Brain: A Computer Vision Point of View and Approach
2007-08-07

Diamant,Emanuel

We live in the Information Age, and information has become a critically
important component of our life. The success of the Internet made huge amounts
of it easily available and accessible to everyone. To keep the flow of this
information manageable, means for its faultless circulation and effective
handling have become urgently required. Considerable research efforts are
dedicated today to address this necessity, but they are seriously hampered by
the lack of a common agreement about "What is information?" In particular, what
is "visual information" - human's primary input from the surrounding world. The
problem is further aggravated by a long-lasting stance borrowed from the
biological vision research that assumes human-like information processing as an
enigmatic mix of perceptual and cognitive vision faculties. I am trying to find
a remedy for this bizarre situation. Relying on a new definition of
"information", which can be derived from Kolmogorov's compexity theory and
Chaitin's notion of algorithmic information, I propose a unifying framework for
visual information processing, which explicitly accounts for the perceptual and
cognitive image processing peculiarities. I believe that this framework will be
useful to overcome the difficulties that are impeding our attempts to develop
the right model of human-like intelligent image processing.

Nodally 3-connected planar graphs and convex combination mappings
2007-08-07

Dunlaing,Colm O

A convex combination mapping of a planar graph is a plane mapping in which
the external vertices are mapped to the corners of a convex polygon and every
internal vertex is a proper weighted average of its neighbours. If a planar
graph is nodally 3-connected or triangulated then every such mapping is an
embedding (Tutte, Floater).
  We give a simple characterisation of nodally 3-connected planar graphs, and
generalise the above result to any planar graph which admits any convex
embedding.

Near Optimal Broadcast with Network Coding in Large Sensor Networks
2007-08-07

Adjih,Cédric
Cho,Song Yean
Jacquet,Philippe

We study efficient broadcasting for wireless sensor networks, with network
coding. We address this issue for homogeneous sensor networks in the plane. Our
results are based on a simple principle (IREN/IRON), which sets the same rate
on most of the nodes (wireless links) of the network. With this rate selection,
we give a value of the maximum achievable broadcast rate of the source: our
central result is a proof of the value of the min-cut for such networks, viewed
as hypergraphs. Our metric for efficiency is the number of transmissions
necessary to transmit one packet from the source to every destination: we show
that IREN/IRON achieves near optimality for large networks; that is,
asymptotically, nearly every transmission brings new information from the
source to the receiver. As a consequence, network coding asymptotically
outperforms any scheme that does not use network coding.

From symmetry break to Poisson point process in 2D Voronoi tessellations: the generic nature of hexagons
2007-08-07

Lucarini,Valerio

We bridge the properties of the regular square and honeycomb Voronoi
tessellations of the plane to those of the Poisson-Voronoi case, thus analyzing
in a common framework symmetry-break processes and the approach to uniformly
random distributions of tessellation-generating points. We consider ensemble
simulations of tessellations generated by points whose regular positions are
perturbed through a Gaussian noise controlled by the parameter alpha. We study
the number of sides, the area, and the perimeter of the Voronoi cells. For
alpha>0, hexagons are the most common class of cells, and 2-parameter gamma
distributions describe well the statistics of the geometrical characteristics.
The symmetry break due to noise destroys the square tessellation, whereas the
honeycomb hexagonal tessellation is very stable and all Voronoi cells are
hexagon for small but finite noise with alpha<0.1. For a moderate amount of
Gaussian noise, memory of the specific unperturbed tessellation is lost,
because the statistics of the two perturbed tessellations is indistinguishable.
When alpha>2, results converge to those of Poisson-Voronoi tessellations. The
properties of n-sided cells change with alpha until the Poisson-Voronoi limit
is reached for alpha>2. The Desch law for perimeters is confirmed to be not
valid and a square root dependence on n is established. The ensemble mean of
the cells area and perimeter restricted to the hexagonal cells coincides with
the full ensemble mean; this might imply that the number of sides acts as a
thermodynamic state variable fluctuating about n=6; this reinforces the idea
that hexagons, beyond their ubiquitous numerical prominence, can be taken as
generic polygons in 2D Voronoi tessellations.

A Formulation of the Channel Capacity of Multiple-Access Channel
2007-08-07

Watanabe,Yoichiro
Kamoi,Koichi

The necessary and sufficient condition of the channel capacity is rigorously
formulated for the N-user discrete memoryless multiple-access channel (MAC).
The essence of the formulation is to invoke an {\em elementary} MAC where sizes
of input alphabets are not greater than the size of output alphabet. The main
objective is to demonstrate that the channel capacity of an MAC is achieved by
an elementary MAC included in the original MAC. The proof is quite
straightforward by the very definition of the elementary MAC. Moreover it is
proved that the Kuhn-Tucker conditions of the elementary MAC are strictly
sufficient and obviously necessary for the channel capacity. The latter proof
requires some steps such that for the elementary MAC every solution of the
Kuhn-Tucker conditions reveals itself as local maximum on the domain of all
possible input probability distributions and then it achieves the channel
capacity. As a result, in respect of the channel capacity, the MAC in general
can be regarded as an aggregate of a finite number of elementary MAC's.

An Interval Analysis Based Study for the Design and the Comparison of 3-DOF Parallel Kinematic Machines

Chablat,Damien
Wenger,Philippe
Majou,Félix
Merlet,Jean-Pierre

This paper addresses an interval analysis based study that is applied to the
design and the comparison of 3-DOF parallel kinematic machines. Two design
criteria are used, (i) a regular workspace shape and, (ii) a kinetostatic
performance index that needs to be as homogeneous as possible throughout the
workspace. The interval analysis based method takes these two criteria into
account: on the basis of prescribed kinetostatic performances, the workspace is
analysed to find out the largest regular dextrous workspace enclosed in the
Cartesian workspace. An algorithm describing this method is introduced. Two
3-DOF translational parallel mechanisms designed for machining applications are
compared using this method. The first machine features three fixed linear
joints which are mounted orthogonally and the second one features three linear
joints which are mounted in parallel. In both cases, the mobile platform moves
in the Cartesian x-y-z space with fixed orientation.

A variant of the Recoil Growth algorithm to generate multi-polymer systems

The Recoil Growth algorithm, proposed in 1999 by Consta et al., is one of the
most efficient algorithm available in the literature to sample from a
multi-polymer system. Such problems are closely related to the generation of
self-avoiding paths. In this paper, we study a variant of the original Recoil
Growth algorithm, where we constrain the generation of a new polymer to take
place on a specific class of graphs. This makes it possible to make a fine
trade-off between computational cost and success rate. We moreover give a
simple proof for a lower bound on the irreducibility of this new algorithm,
which applies to the original algorithm as well.

A Practical Ontology for the Large-Scale Modeling of Scholarly Artifacts and their Usage

Bollen,Johah

The large-scale analysis of scholarly artifact usage is constrained primarily
by current practices in usage data archiving, privacy issues concerned with the
dissemination of usage data, and the lack of a practical ontology for modeling
the usage domain. As a remedy to the third constraint, this article presents a
scholarly ontology that was engineered to represent those classes for which
large-scale bibliographic and usage data exists, supports usage research, and
whose instantiation is scalable to the order of 50 million articles along with
their associated artifacts (e.g. authors and journals) and an accompanying 1
billion usage events. The real world instantiation of the presented abstract
ontology is a semantic network model of the scholarly community which lends the
scholarly process to statistical analysis and computational support. We present
the ontology, discuss its instantiation, and provide some example inference
rules for calculating various scholarly artifact metrics.

Diversity-Multiplexing Tradeoff of Asynchronous Cooperative Diversity in Wireless Networks
2007-08-08

Wei,Shuangqing

Synchronization of relay nodes is an important and critical issue in
exploiting cooperative diversity in wireless networks. In this paper, two
asynchronous cooperative diversity schemes are proposed, namely, distributed
delay diversity and asynchronous space-time coded cooperative diversity
schemes. In terms of the overall diversity-multiplexing (DM) tradeoff function,
we show that the proposed independent coding based distributed delay diversity
and asynchronous space-time coded cooperative diversity schemes achieve the
same performance as the synchronous space-time coded approach which requires an
accurate symbol-level timing synchronization to ensure signals arriving at the
destination from different relay nodes are perfectly synchronized. This
demonstrates diversity order is maintained even at the presence of asynchronism
between relay node. Moreover, when all relay nodes succeed in decoding the
source information, the asynchronous space-time coded approach is capable of
achieving better DM-tradeoff than synchronous schemes and performs equivalently
to transmitting information through a parallel fading channel as far as the
DM-tradeoff is concerned. Our results suggest the benefits of fully exploiting
the space-time degrees of freedom in multiple antenna systems by employing
asynchronous space-time codes even in a frequency flat fading channel. In
addition, it is shown asynchronous space-time coded systems are able to achieve
higher mutual information than synchronous space-time coded systems for any
finite signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) when properly selected baseband waveforms
are employed.

A Deterministic Sub-linear Time Sparse Fourier Algorithm via Non-adaptive Compressed Sensing Methods
2007-08-09

Iwen,M. A.

We study the problem of estimating the best B term Fourier representation for
a given frequency-sparse signal (i.e., vector) $\textbf{A}$ of length $N \gg
B$. More explicitly, we investigate how to deterministically identify B of the
largest magnitude frequencies of $\hat{\textbf{A}}$, and estimate their
coefficients, in polynomial$(B,\log N)$ time. Randomized sub-linear time
algorithms which have a small (controllable) probability of failure for each
processed signal exist for solving this problem. However, for failure
intolerant applications such as those involving mission-critical hardware
designed to process many signals over a long lifetime, deterministic algorithms
with no probability of failure are highly desirable. In this paper we build on
the deterministic Compressed Sensing results of Cormode and Muthukrishnan (CM)
\cite{CMDetCS3,CMDetCS1,CMDetCS2} in order to develop the first known
deterministic sub-linear time sparse Fourier Transform algorithm suitable for
failure intolerant applications. Furthermore, in the process of developing our
new Fourier algorithm, we present a simplified deterministic Compressed Sensing
algorithm which improves on CM's algebraic compressibility results while
simultaneously maintaining their results concerning exponential decay.

Cost-minimising strategies for data labelling : optimal stopping and active learning
2007-08-09
2007-11-15
Dimitrakakis,Christos
Savu-Krohn,Christian

Supervised learning deals with the inference of a distribution over an output
or label space $\CY$ conditioned on points in an observation space $\CX$, given
a training dataset $D$ of pairs in $\CX \times \CY$. However, in a lot of
applications of interest, acquisition of large amounts of observations is easy,
while the process of generating labels is time-consuming or costly. One way to
deal with this problem is {\em active} learning, where points to be labelled
are selected with the aim of creating a model with better performance than that
of an model trained on an equal number of randomly sampled points. In this
paper, we instead propose to deal with the labelling cost directly: The
learning goal is defined as the minimisation of a cost which is a function of
the expected model performance and the total cost of the labels used. This
allows the development of general strategies and specific algorithms for (a)
optimal stopping, where the expected cost dictates whether label acquisition
should continue (b) empirical evaluation, where the cost is used as a
performance metric for a given combination of inference, stopping and sampling
methods. Though the main focus of the paper is optimal stopping, we also aim to
provide the background for further developments and discussion in the related
field of active learning.

describe the algebraic parameters of the codes in a more accessible way. We
show that the existence of such codes with given algebraic parameters can be
reduced to the solvability of a modified rook problem. It is our strong belief
that the rook problem is always solvable, and we present solutions in
particular cases.

Physical limits of inference
2007-08-09
2008-10-23
Wolpert,David H.

I show that physical devices that perform observation, prediction, or
recollection share an underlying mathematical structure. I call devices with
that structure "inference devices". I present a set of existence and
impossibility results concerning inference devices. These results hold
independent of the precise physical laws governing our universe. In a limited
sense, the impossibility results establish that Laplace was wrong to claim that
even in a classical, non-chaotic universe the future can be unerringly
predicted, given sufficient knowledge of the present. Alternatively, these
impossibility results can be viewed as a non-quantum mechanical "uncertainty
principle". Next I explore the close connections between the mathematics of
inference devices and of Turing Machines. In particular, the impossibility
results for inference devices are similar to the Halting theorem for TM's.
Furthermore, one can define an analog of Universal TM's (UTM's) for inference
devices. I call those analogs "strong inference devices". I use strong
inference devices to define the "inference complexity" of an inference task,
which is the analog of the Kolmogorov complexity of computing a string. However
no universe can contain more than one strong inference device. So whereas the
Kolmogorov complexity of a string is arbitrary up to specification of the UTM,
there is no such arbitrariness in the inference complexity of an inference
task. I end by discussing the philosophical implications of these results,
e.g., for whether the universe "is" a computer.

Achievable Outage Rates with Improved Decoding of Bicm Multiband Ofdm Under Channel Estimation Errors
2007-08-10

Sadough,Sajad

We consider the decoding of bit interleaved coded modulation (BICM) applied
to multiband OFDM for practical scenarios where only a noisy (possibly very
bad) estimate of the channel is available at the receiver. First, a decoding
metric based on the channel it a posteriori probability density, conditioned on
the channel estimate is derived and used for decoding BICM multiband OFDM.
Then, we characterize the limits of reliable information rates in terms of the
maximal achievable outage rates associated to the proposed metric. We also
compare our results with the outage rates of a system using a theoretical
decoder. Our results are useful for designing a communication system where a
prescribed quality of service (QoS), in terms of achievable target rates with
small error probability, must be satisfied even in the presence of imperfect
channel estimation. Numerical results over both realistic UWB and theoretical
Rayleigh fading channels show that the proposed method provides significant
gain in terms of BER and outage rates compared to the classical mismatched
detector, without introducing any additional complexity.

the channel a posteriori density, we adopt a practical decoding metric that is
robust to the presence of channel estimation errors. Then this metric is used
in the demapping part of BICM multiband and MIMO OFDM receivers. We also
compare our results with the performance of a mismatched decoder that replaces
the channel by its estimate in the decoding metric. Numerical results over both
realistic UWB and theoretical Rayleigh fading channels show that the proposed
method provides significant gain in terms of bit error rate compared to the
classical mismatched detector, without introducing any additional complexity.

Wavelet Based Semi-blind Channel Estimation For Multiband OFDM
2007-08-10

Sadough,Sajad
Ichir,Mahieddine
Jaffrot,Emmanuel
Duhamel,Pierre

This paper introduces an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm within a
wavelet domain Bayesian framework for semi-blind channel estimation of
multiband OFDM based UWB communications. A prior distribution is chosen for the
wavelet coefficients of the unknown channel impulse response in order to model
a sparseness property of the wavelet representation. This prior yields, in
maximum a posteriori estimation, a thresholding rule within the EM algorithm.
We particularly focus on reducing the number of estimated parameters by
iteratively discarding ``unsignificant'' wavelet coefficients from the
estimation process. Simulation results using UWB channels issued from both
models and measurements show that under sparsity conditions, the proposed
algorithm outperforms pilot based channel estimation in terms of mean square
error and bit error rate and enhances the estimation accuracy with less
computational complexity than traditional semi-blind methods.

Optimal decoding of bit interleaved coded modulation (BICM) MIMO-OFDM where

outage rates achieved by a decoder that uses our proposed metric. The
performance of the proposed decoder is compared to the classical mismatched
decoder and a theoretical decoder defined as the best decoder in the presence
of imperfect channel estimation. Numerical results over Rayleigh block fading
MIMO-OFDM channels show that the proposed decoder outperforms mismatched
decoding in terms of bit error rate and outage capacity without introducing any

A Light-Based Device for Solving the Hamiltonian Path Problem

connections between nodes. In each node the rays are uniquely marked so that
they can be easily identified. At the destination node we will search only for
particular rays that have passed only once through each node. We show that the
proposed device can solve small and medium instances of the problem in
reasonable time.

Defensive forecasting for optimal prediction with expert advice
2007-08-10

Vovk,Vladimir

The method of defensive forecasting is applied to the problem of prediction
with expert advice for binary outcomes. It turns out that defensive forecasting
is not only competitive with the Aggregating Algorithm but also handles the
case of "second-guessing" experts, whose advice depends on the learner's
prediction; this paper assumes that the dependence on the learner's prediction
is continuous.

Solving the Hamiltonian path problem with a light-based computer
2007-08-10

Oltean,Mihai

In this paper we propose a special computational device which uses light rays
for solving the Hamiltonian path problem on a directed graph. The device has a
graph-like representation and the light is traversing it by following the
routes given by the connections between nodes. In each node the rays are
uniquely marked so that they can be easily identified. At the destination node
we will search only for particular rays that have passed only once through each
node. We show that the proposed device can solve small and medium instances of
the problem in reasonable time.

A Data-Parallel Version of Aleph
2007-08-10

Konstantopoulos,Stasinos

This is to present work on modifying the Aleph ILP system so that it
evaluates the hypothesised clauses in parallel by distributing the data-set
among the nodes of a parallel or distributed machine. The paper briefly
discusses MPI, the interface used to access message- passing libraries for
parallel computers and clusters. It then proceeds to describe an extension of
YAP Prolog with an MPI interface and an implementation of data-parallel clause
evaluation for Aleph through this interface. The paper concludes by testing the
data-parallel Aleph on artificially constructed data-sets.

Resolution over Linear Equations and Multilinear Proofs
2007-08-10

Raz,Ran
Tzameret,Iddo

We develop and study the complexity of propositional proof systems of varying
strength extending resolution by allowing it to operate with disjunctions of
linear equations instead of clauses. We demonstrate polynomial-size refutations
for hard tautologies like the pigeonhole principle, Tseitin graph tautologies
and the clique-coloring tautologies in these proof systems. Using the
(monotone) interpolation by a communication game technique we establish an
exponential-size lower bound on refutations in a certain, considerably strong,
fragment of resolution over linear equations, as well as a general polynomial
upper bound on (non-monotone) interpolants in this fragment.
  We then apply these results to extend and improve previous results on
multilinear proofs (over fields of characteristic 0), as studied in
[RazTzameret06]. Specifically, we show the following:
  1. Proofs operating with depth-3 multilinear formulas polynomially simulate a
certain, considerably strong, fragment of resolution over linear equations.
  2. Proofs operating with depth-3 multilinear formulas admit polynomial-size
refutations of the pigeonhole principle and Tseitin graph tautologies. The
former improve over a previous result that established small multilinear proofs
only for the \emph{functional} pigeonhole principle. The latter are different
than previous proofs, and apply to multilinear proofs of Tseitin mod p graph
tautologies over any field of characteristic 0.
  We conclude by connecting resolution over linear equations with extensions of
the cutting planes proof system.

Learning Phonotactics Using ILP

This paper describes experiments on learning Dutch phonotactic rules using
Inductive Logic Programming, a machine learning discipline based on inductive
logical operators. Two different ways of approaching the problem are

informedness of the background knowledge and the constructed theory,
demonstrating the ability of ILP to take good advantage of the prior domain

Homogeneous temporal activity patterns in a large online communication space

Kaltenbrunner,Andreas
Gómez,Vicenç
Moghnieh,Ayman
Meza,Rodrigo
Blat,Josep
López,Vicente

The many-to-many social communication activity on the popular technology-news
website Slashdot has been studied. We have concentrated on the dynamics of
message production without considering semantic relations and have found
regular temporal patterns in the reaction time of the community to a news-post
as well as in single user behavior. The statistics of these activities follow
log-normal distributions. Daily and weekly oscillatory cycles, which cause
slight variations of this simple behavior, are identified. A superposition of
two log-normal distributions can account for these variations. The findings are
remarkable since the distribution of the number of comments per users, which is
also analyzed, indicates a great amount of heterogeneity in the community. The
reader may find surprising that only a few parameters allow a detailed
description, or even prediction, of social many-to-many information exchange in
this kind of popular public spaces.

Optimal Causal Inference: Estimating Stored Information and Approximating Causal Architecture
2007-08-11
2010-08-19
Still,Susanne
Crutchfield,James P.
Ellison,Christopher J.

We introduce an approach to inferring the causal architecture of stochastic
dynamical systems that extends rate distortion theory to use causal
shielding---a natural principle of learning. We study two distinct cases of
causal inference: optimal causal filtering and optimal causal estimation.
  Filtering corresponds to the ideal case in which the probability distribution
of measurement sequences is known, giving a principled method to approximate a
system's causal structure at a desired level of representation. We show that,
in the limit in which a model complexity constraint is relaxed, filtering finds
the exact causal architecture of a stochastic dynamical system, known as the
causal-state partition. From this, one can estimate the amount of historical
information the process stores. More generally, causal filtering finds a graded
model-complexity hierarchy of approximations to the causal architecture. Abrupt
changes in the hierarchy, as a function of approximation, capture distinct
scales of structural organization.
  For nonideal cases with finite data, we show how the correct number of
underlying causal states can be found by optimal causal estimation. A
previously derived model complexity control term allows us to correct for the
effect of statistical fluctuations in probability estimates and thereby avoid
over-fitting.

constraints, when they should be processed sequentially and when
simultaneously. As an illustration, the multinomial example of die tosses is
solved in detail for two superficially similar but actually very different

Hybrid Branching-Time Logics
2007-08-13

Weber,Volker

Hybrid branching-time logics are introduced as extensions of CTL-like logics
with state variables and the downarrow-binder. Following recent work in the
linear framework, only logics with a single variable are considered. The
expressive power and the complexity of satisfiability of the resulting logics
is investigated.
  As main result, the satisfiability problem for the hybrid versions of several
branching-time logics is proved to be 2EXPTIME-complete. These branching-time
logics range from strict fragments of CTL to extensions of CTL that can talk
about the past and express fairness-properties. The complexity gap relative to
CTL is explained by a corresponding succinctness result.
  To prove the upper bound, the automata-theoretic approach to branching-time
logics is extended to hybrid logics, showing that non-emptiness of alternating
one-pebble Buchi tree automata is 2EXPTIME-complete.

Design: One, but in different forms

Visser,Willemien

This overview paper defends an augmented cognitively oriented generic-design
hypothesis: there are both significant similarities between the design
activities implemented in different situations and crucial differences between
these and other cognitive activities; yet, characteristics of a design
situation (related to the design process, the designers, and the artefact)
introduce specificities in the corresponding cognitive activities and
structures that are used, and in the resulting designs. We thus augment the
classical generic-design hypothesis with that of different forms of designing.
We review the data available in the cognitive design research literature and
propose a series of candidates underlying such forms of design, outlining a
number of directions requiring further elaboration.

Multiple-Description Coding by Dithered Delta-Sigma Quantization
2007-08-14
2009-07-15
Ostergaard,Jan
Zamir,Ram

We address the connection between the multiple-description (MD) problem and
Delta-Sigma quantization. The inherent redundancy due to oversampling in
Delta-Sigma quantization, and the simple linear-additive noise model resulting
from dithered lattice quantization, allow us to construct a symmetric and
time-invariant MD coding scheme. We show that the use of a noise shaping filter
makes it possible to trade off central distortion for side distortion.
Asymptotically as the dimension of the lattice vector quantizer and order of
the noise shaping filter approach infinity, the entropy rate of the dithered
Delta-Sigma quantization scheme approaches the symmetric two-channel MD
rate-distortion function for a memoryless Gaussian source and MSE fidelity
criterion, at any side-to-central distortion ratio and any resolution. In the
optimal scheme, the infinite-order noise shaping filter must be minimum phase
and have a piece-wise flat power spectrum with a single jump discontinuity. An
important advantage of the proposed design is that it is symmetric in rate and
distortion by construction, so the coding rates of the descriptions are
identical and there is therefore no need for source splitting.

A nearly tight memory-redundancy trade-off for one-pass compression

encode $s$ in (n H_k (s) + O (\sigma^k n^{1 - c + \epsilon})) bits for all
integers (k \geq 0) simultaneously. On the other hand, even with unlimited
time, using (O (n^c)) bits of memory and one pass we cannot always encode $s$
in (O (n H_k (s) + \sigma^k n^{1 - c - \epsilon})) bits for, e.g., (k = \lceil

Exact Cover with light

We suggest a new optical solution for solving the YES/NO version of the Exact
Cover problem by using the massive parallelism of light. The idea is to build
an optical device which can generate all possible solutions of the problem and
then to pick the correct one. In our case the device has a graph-like
representation and the light is traversing it by following the routes given by
the connections between nodes. The nodes are connected by arcs in a special way
which lets us to generate all possible covers (exact or not) of the given set.
For selecting the correct solution we assign to each item, from the set to be
covered, a special integer number. These numbers will actually represent delays
induced to light when it passes through arcs. The solution is represented as a
subray arriving at a certain moment in the destination node. This will tell us
if an exact cover does exist or not.

through an arc it is delayed by the amount of time indicated by the number
placed in that arc. At the destination node we will check if there is a ray
whose total delay is equal to the target value of the subset sum problem (plus
some constants).

Who is the best connected EC researcher? Centrality analysis of the complex network of authors in evolutionary computation

community, the first paper dealing with it having been published two years ago.
In this paper we will study the co-authorship network of EC at a microscopic
level. Our objective is ascertaining which are the most relevant nodes (i.e.
authors) in it. For this purpose, we examine several metrics defined in the
complex-network literature, and analyze them both in isolation and combined
within a Pareto-dominance approach. The result of our analysis indicates that
there are some well-known researchers that appear systematically in top
rankings. This also provides some hints on the social behavior of our
community.

Repairing Inconsistent XML Write-Access Control Policies

XML access control policies involving updates may contain security flaws,
here called inconsistencies, in which a forbidden operation may be simulated by
performing a sequence of allowed operations. This paper investigates the
problem of deciding whether a policy is consistent, and if not, how its
inconsistencies can be repaired. We consider policies expressed in terms of
annotated DTDs defining which operations are allowed or denied for the XML
trees that are instances of the DTD. We show that consistency is decidable in
PTIME for such policies and that consistent partial policies can be extended to
unique "least-privilege" consistent total policies. We also consider repair
problems based on deleting privileges to restore consistency, show that finding
minimal repairs is NP-complete, and give heuristics for finding repairs.

Obstructions to Genericity in Study of Parametric Problems in Control Theory
2007-08-15

Levandovskyy,Viktor
Zerz,Eva

We investigate systems of equations, involving parameters from the point of
view of both control theory and computer algebra. The equations might involve
linear operators such as partial (q-)differentiation, (q-)shift, (q-)difference
as well as more complicated ones, which act trivially on the parameters. Such a
system can be identified algebraically with a certain left module over a
non-commutative algebra, where the operators commute with the parameters. We
develop, implement and use in practice the algorithm for revealing all the
expressions in parameters, for which e.g. homological properties of a system
differ from the generic properties. We use Groebner bases and Groebner basics
in rings of solvable type as main tools. In particular, we demonstrate an
optimized algorithm for computing the left inverse of a matrix over a ring of
solvable type. We illustrate the article with interesting examples. In
particular, we provide a complete solution to the "two pendula, mounted on a
cart" problem from the classical book of Polderman and Willems, including the
case, where the friction at the joints is essential . To the best of our
knowledge, the latter example has not been solved before in a complete way.

Attribute Estimation and Testing Quasi-Symmetry
2007-08-15

Majewski,Krzysztof
Pippenger,Nicholas

A Boolean function is symmetric if it is invariant under all permutations of
its arguments; it is quasi-symmetric if it is symmetric with respect to the
arguments on which it actually depends. We present a test that accepts every
quasi-symmetric function and, except with an error probability at most delta>0,
rejects every function that differs from every quasi-symmetric function on at
least a fraction epsilon>0 of the inputs. For a function of n arguments, the
test probes the function at O((n/epsilon)\log(n/delta)) inputs. Our
quasi-symmetry test acquires information concerning the arguments on which the
function actually depends. To do this, it employs a generalization of the
property testing paradigm that we call attribute estimation. Like property
testing, attribute estimation uses random sampling to obtain results that have
only "one-sided'' errors and that are close to accurate with high probability.

Provenance is information recording the source, derivation, or history of

analysis techniques familiar from program analysis and program slicing provide
a formal foundation for forms of provenance that are intended to show how (part
of) the output of a query depends on (parts of) its input. We introduce a
semantic characterization of such dependency provenance, show that this form of
provenance is not computable, and provide dynamic and static approximation
techniques.

Collection analysis for Horn clause programs
2007-08-16

Miller,Dale

We consider approximating data structures with collections of the items that
they contain. For examples, lists, binary trees, tuples, etc, can be
approximated by sets or multisets of the items within them. Such approximations
can be used to provide partial correctness properties of logic programs. For
example, one might wish to specify than whenever the atom $sort(t,s)$ is proved
then the two lists $t$ and $s$ contain the same multiset of items (that is, $s$
is a permutation of $t$). If sorting removes duplicates, then one would like to
infer that the sets of items underlying $t$ and $s$ are the same. Such results
could be useful to have if they can be determined statically and automatically.
We present a scheme by which such collection analysis can be structured and
automated. Central to this scheme is the use of linear logic as a omputational
logic underlying the logic of Horn clauses.

A focused proof system provides a normal form to cut-free proofs that
structures the application of invertible and non-invertible inference rules.
The focused proof system of Andreoli for linear logic has been applied to both
the proof search and the proof normalization approaches to computation. Various
proof systems in literature exhibit characteristics of focusing to one degree
or another. We present a new, focused proof system for intuitionistic logic,
called LJF, and show how other proof systems can be mapped into the new system
by inserting logical connectives that prematurely stop focusing. We also use
LJF to design a focused proof system for classical logic. Our approach to the
design and analysis of these systems is based on the completeness of focusing
in linear logic and on the notion of polarity that appears in Girard's LC and
LU proof systems.

A Language for Generic Programming in the Large
2007-08-16

Siek,Jeremy G.
Lumsdaine,Andrew

Generic programming is an effective methodology for developing reusable
software libraries. Many programming languages provide generics and have
features for describing interfaces, but none completely support the idioms used
in generic programming. To address this need we developed the language G. The
central feature of G is the concept, a mechanism for organizing constraints on
generics that is inspired by the needs of modern C++ libraries. G provides
modular type checking and separate compilation (even of generics). These
characteristics support modular software development, especially the smooth
integration of independently developed components. In this article we present
the rationale for the design of G and demonstrate the expressiveness of G with
two case studies: porting the Standard Template Library and the Boost Graph
Library from C++ to G. The design of G shares much in common with the concept
extension proposed for the next C++ Standard (the authors participated in its
design) but there are important differences described in this article.

The study of a new gerrymandering methodology
2007-08-16

Kai,Pan
Yue,Tan
Sheng,Jiang

This paper is to obtain a simple dividing-diagram of the congressional
districts, where the only limit is that each district should contain the same
population if possibly. In order to solve this problem, we introduce three
different standards of the "simple" shape. The first standard is that the final
shape of the congressional districts should be of a simplest figure and we
apply a modified "shortest split line algorithm" where the factor of the same
population is considered only. The second standard is that the gerrymandering
should ensure the integrity of the current administrative area as the
convenience for management. Thus we combine the factor of the administrative
area with the first standard, and generate an improved model resulting in the
new diagram in which the perimeters of the districts are along the boundaries
of some current counties. Moreover, the gerrymandering should consider the
geographic features.The third standard is introduced to describe this
situation. Finally, it can be proved that the difference between the supporting
ratio of a certain party in each district and the average supporting ratio of
that particular party in the whole state obeys the Chi-square distribution
approximately. Consequently, we can obtain an archetypal formula to check
whether the gerrymandering we propose is fair.

Capacity of the Degraded Half-Duplex Relay Channel
2007-08-16

Vijayakumaran,Saravanan
Wong,Tan F.
Lok,Tat M.

A discrete memoryless half-duplex relay channel is constructed from a
broadcast channel from the source to the relay and destination and a multiple
access channel from the source and relay to the destination. When the relay
listens, the channel operates in the broadcast mode. The channel switches to
the multiple access mode when the relay transmits. If the broadcast component
channel is physically degraded, the half-duplex relay channel will also be
referred to as physically degraded. The capacity of this degraded half-duplex
relay channel is examined. It is shown that the block Markov coding suggested
in the seminal paper by Cover and El Gamal can be modified to achieve capacity
for the degraded half-duplex relay channel. In the code construction, the
listen-transmit schedule of the relay is made to depend on the message to be
sent and hence the schedule carries information itself. If the schedule is
restricted to be deterministic, it is shown that the capacity can be achieved
by a simple management of information flows across the broadcast and multiple
access component channels.

Opportunism in Multiuser Relay Channels: Scheduling, Routing and Spectrum Reuse
2007-08-16

Oyman,Ozgur

In order to understand the key merits of multiuser diversity techniques in
relay-assisted cellular multihop networks, this paper analyzes the spectral
efficiency of opportunistic (i.e., channel-aware) scheduling algorithms over a
fading multiuser relay channel with $K$ users in the asymptotic regime of large
(but finite) number of users. Using tools from extreme-value theory, we
characterize the limiting distribution of spectral efficiency focusing on Type
I convergence and utilize it in investigating the large system behavior of the
multiuser relay channel as a function of the number of users and physical
channel signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). Our analysis results in very accurate
formulas in the large (but finite) $K$ regime, provides insights on the
potential performance enhancements from multihop routing and spectrum reuse
policies in the presence of multiuser diversity gains from opportunistic
scheduling and helps to identify the regimes and conditions in which
relay-assisted multiuser communication provides a clear advantage over direct
multiuser communication.

On Compact Routing for the Internet

Krioukov,Dmitri
claffy,kc
Fall,Kevin
Brady,Arthur

While there exist compact routing schemes designed for grids, trees, and
Internet-like topologies that offer routing tables of sizes that scale
logarithmically with the network size, we demonstrate in this paper that in
view of recent results in compact routing research, such logarithmic scaling on
Internet-like topologies is fundamentally impossible in the presence of
topology dynamics or topology-independent (flat) addressing. We use analytic
arguments to show that the number of routing control messages per topology
change cannot scale better than linearly on Internet-like topologies. We also
employ simulations to confirm that logarithmic routing table size scaling gets
broken by topology-independent addressing, a cornerstone of popular
locator-identifier split proposals aiming at improving routing scaling in the
presence of network topology dynamics or host mobility. These pessimistic
findings lead us to the conclusion that a fundamental re-examination of
assumptions behind routing models and abstractions is needed in order to find a
routing architecture that would be able to scale ``indefinitely.''

Benefiting from Disorder: Source Coding for Unordered Data
2007-08-16

Varshney,Lav R.
Goyal,Vivek K.

The order of letters is not always relevant in a communication task. This
paper discusses the implications of order irrelevance on source coding,
presenting results in several major branches of source coding theory: lossless
coding, universal lossless coding, rate-distortion, high-rate quantization, and
universal lossy coding. The main conclusions demonstrate that there is a
significant rate savings when order is irrelevant. In particular, lossless
coding of n letters from a finite alphabet requires Theta(log n) bits and
universal lossless coding requires n + o(n) bits for many countable alphabet
sources. However, there are no universal schemes that can drive a strong
redundancy measure to zero. Results for lossy coding include distribution-free
expressions for the rate savings from order irrelevance in various high-rate
quantization schemes. Rate-distortion bounds are given, and it is shown that
the analogue of the Shannon lower bound is loose at all finite rates.

On Semimeasures Predicting Martin-Loef Random Sequences
2007-08-17

Hutter,Marcus
Muchnik,Andrej

Solomonoff's central result on induction is that the posterior of a universal
semimeasure M converges rapidly and with probability 1 to the true sequence
generating posterior mu, if the latter is computable. Hence, M is eligible as a
universal sequence predictor in case of unknown mu. Despite some nearby results
and proofs in the literature, the stronger result of convergence for all
(Martin-Loef) random sequences remained open. Such a convergence result would
be particularly interesting and natural, since randomness can be defined in
terms of M itself. We show that there are universal semimeasures M which do not
converge for all random sequences, i.e. we give a partial negative answer to
the open problem. We also provide a positive answer for some non-universal
semimeasures. We define the incomputable measure D as a mixture over all
computable measures and the enumerable semimeasure W as a mixture over all
enumerable nearly-measures. We show that W converges to D and D to mu on all
random sequences. The Hellinger distance measuring closeness of two
distributions plays a central role.

Unsatisfiable Linear k-CNFs Exist, for every k
2007-08-17

Scheder,Dominik

We call a CNF formula linear if any two clauses have at most one variable in
common. Let Linear k-SAT be the problem of deciding whether a given linear
k-CNF formula is satisfiable. Here, a k-CNF formula is a CNF formula in which
every clause has size exactly k. It was known that for k >= 3, Linear k-SAT is
NP-complete if and only if an unsatisfiable linear k-CNF formula exists, and
that they do exist for k >= 4. We prove that unsatisfiable linear k-CNF
formulas exist for every k. Let f(k) be the minimum number of clauses in an
unsatisfiable linear k-CNF formula. We show that f(k) is Omega(k2^k) and
O(4^k*k^4), i.e., minimum size unsatisfiable linear k-CNF formulas are
significantly larger than minimum size unsatisfiable k-CNF formulas. Finally,
we prove that, surprisingly, linear k-CNF formulas do not allow for a larger
fraction of clauses to be satisfied than general k-CNF formulas.

Randomized algorithm for the k-server problem on decomposable spaces
2007-08-17

Nagy-György,Judit

We study the randomized k-server problem on metric spaces consisting of
widely separated subspaces. We give a method which extends existing algorithms
to larger spaces with the growth rate of the competitive quotients being at
most O(log k). This method yields o(k)-competitive algorithms solving the
randomized k-server problem, for some special underlying metric spaces, e.g.
HSTs of "small" height (but unbounded degree). HSTs are important tools for
probabilistic approximation of metric spaces.

Continuous and randomized defensive forecasting: unified view
2007-08-17
2007-08-23
Vovk,Vladimir

Defensive forecasting is a method of transforming laws of probability (stated
in game-theoretic terms as strategies for Sceptic) into forecasting algorithms.
There are two known varieties of defensive forecasting: "continuous", in which
Sceptic's moves are assumed to depend on the forecasts in a (semi)continuous
manner and which produces deterministic forecasts, and "randomized", in which
the dependence of Sceptic's moves on the forecasts is arbitrary and
Forecaster's moves are allowed to be randomized. This note shows that the
randomized variety can be obtained from the continuous variety by smearing
Sceptic's moves to make them continuous.

On a constructive characterization of a class of trees related to pairs of disjoint matchings
2007-08-17

Kamalian,R. R.
Mkrtchyan,V. V.

For a graph consider the pairs of disjoint matchings which union contains as
many edges as possible, and define a parameter $\alpha$ which eqauls the
cardinality of the largest matching in those pairs. Also, define $\betta$ to be
the cardinality of a maximum matching of the graph.
  We give a constructive characterization of trees which satisfy the
$\alpha$=$\betta$ equality. The proof of our main theorem is based on a new
decomposition algorithm obtained for trees.

Key Agreement and Authentication Schemes Using Non-Commutative Semigroups

Chowdhury,M. M.

We give a new two-pass authentication scheme, whichis a generalisation of an
authentication scheme of Sibert-Dehornoy-Girault based on the Diffie-Hellman
conjugacy problem. Compared to the above scheme, for some parameters it is more
efficient with respect to multiplications. We sketch a proof that our
authentication scheme is secure. We give a new key agreement protocols.

On the AAGL Protocol
2007-08-17
2007-11-22
Chowdhury,M. M.

Recently the AAGL (Anshel-Anshel-Goldfeld-Lemieux) has been proposed which
can be used for RFID tags. We give algorithms for the problem (we call the
MSCSPv) on which the security of the AAGL protocol is based upon. Hence we give
various attacks for general parameters on the recent AAGL protocol proposed.
One of our attacks is a deterministic algorithm which has space complexity and
time complexity both atleast exponentialin the worst case. In a better case
using a probabilistic algorithm the time complexity canbe
O(|XSS(ui')^L5*(n^(1+e)) and the space complexity can be O(|XSS(ui')|^L6),
where the element ui' is part of a public key, n is the index of braid group,
XSS is a summit type set and e is a constant in a limit. The above shows the
AAGL protocol is potentially not significantly more secure as using key
agreement protocols based on the conjugacy problem such as the AAG
(Anshel-Anshel-Goldfeld) protocol because both protocols can be broken with
complexity which do not significantly differ. We think our attacks can be
improved.

User Participation in Social Media: Digg Study
2007-08-17

Lerman,Kristina

The social news aggregator Digg allows users to submit and moderate stories
by voting on (digging) them. As is true of most social sites, user
participation on Digg is non-uniformly distributed, with few users contributing
a disproportionate fraction of content. We studied user participation on Digg,
to see whether it is motivated by competition, fueled by user ranking, or
social factors, such as community acceptance.
  For our study we collected activity data of the top users weekly over the
course of a year. We computed the number of stories users submitted, dugg or
commented on weekly. We report a spike in user activity in September 2006,
followed by a gradual decline, which seems unaffected by the elimination of
user ranking. The spike can be explained by a controversy that broke out at the
beginning of September 2006. We believe that the lasting acrimony that this
incident has created led to a decline of top user participation on Digg.

A structure from motion inequality
2007-08-18

Knill,Oliver
Ramirez-Herran,Jose

We state an elementary inequality for the structure from motion problem for m
cameras and n points. This structure from motion inequality relates space
dimension, camera parameter dimension, the number of cameras and number points
and global symmetry properties and provides a rigorous criterion for which
reconstruction is not possible with probability 1. Mathematically the
inequality is based on Frobenius theorem which is a geometric incarnation of
the fundamental theorem of linear algebra. The paper also provides a general
mathematical formalism for the structure from motion problem. It includes the
situation the points can move while the camera takes the pictures.

On Ullman's theorem in computer vision

Knill,Oliver
Ramirez-Herran,Jose

Both in the plane and in space, we invert the nonlinear Ullman transformation
for 3 points and 3 orthographic cameras. While Ullman's theorem assures a
unique reconstruction modulo a reflection for 3 cameras and 4 points, we find a
locally unique reconstruction for 3 cameras and 3 points. Explicit
reconstruction formulas allow to decide whether picture data of three cameras
seeing three points can be realized as a point-camera configuration.

Space and camera path reconstruction for omni-directional vision
2007-08-17

Knill,Oliver
Ramirez-Herran,Jose

In this paper, we address the inverse problem of reconstructing a scene as
well as the camera motion from the image sequence taken by an omni-directional
camera. Our structure from motion results give sharp conditions under which the
reconstruction is unique. For example, if there are three points in general
position and three omni-directional cameras in general position, a unique
reconstruction is possible up to a similarity. We then look at the
reconstruction problem with m cameras and n points, where n and m can be large
and the over-determined system is solved by least square methods. The
reconstruction is robust and generalizes to the case of a dynamic environment
where landmarks can move during the movie capture. Possible applications of the
result are computer assisted scene reconstruction, 3D scanning, autonomous
robot navigation, medical tomography and city reconstructions.

On the subset sum problem over finite fields

Li,Jiyou
Wan,Daqing

The subset sum problem over finite fields is a well-known {\bf NP}-complete
problem. It arises naturally from decoding generalized Reed-Solomon codes. In
this paper, we study the number of solutions of the subset sum problem from a
mathematical point of view. In several interesting cases, we obtain explicit or
asymptotic formulas for the solution number. As a consequence, we obtain some
results on the decoding problem of Reed-Solomon codes.

Eigenvalue bounds on the pseudocodeword weight of expander codes
2007-08-18

Kelley,Christine A.
Sridhara,Deepak

Four different ways of obtaining low-density parity-check codes from expander
graphs are considered. For each case, lower bounds on the minimum stopping set
size and the minimum pseudocodeword weight of expander (LDPC) codes are
derived. These bounds are compared with the known eigenvalue-based lower bounds
on the minimum distance of expander codes. Furthermore, Tanner's
parity-oriented eigenvalue lower bound on the minimum distance is generalized
to yield a new lower bound on the minimum pseudocodeword weight. These bounds
are useful in predicting the performance of LDPC codes under graph-based
iterative decoding and linear programming decoding.

Minimum Cost Homomorphisms to Reflexive Digraphs
2007-08-18
2007-10-16
Gupta,Arvind
Hell,Pavol
Karimi,Mehdi
Rafiey,Arash

For digraphs $G$ and $H$, a homomorphism of $G$ to $H$ is a mapping $f:\
V(G)\dom V(H)$ such that $uv\in A(G)$ implies $f(u)f(v)\in A(H)$. If moreover
each vertex $u \in V(G)$ is associated with costs $c_i(u), i \in V(H)$, then
the cost of a homomorphism $f$ is $\sum_{u\in V(G)}c_{f(u)}(u)$. For each fixed
digraph $H$, the {\em minimum cost homomorphism problem} for $H$, denoted
MinHOM($H$), is the following problem. Given an input digraph $G$, together
with costs $c_i(u)$, $u\in V(G)$, $i\in V(H)$, and an integer $k$, decide if
$G$ admits a homomorphism to $H$ of cost not exceeding $k$. We focus on the
minimum cost homomorphism problem for {\em reflexive} digraphs $H$ (every
vertex of $H$ has a loop). It is known that the problem MinHOM($H$) is
polynomial time solvable if the digraph $H$ has a {\em Min-Max ordering}, i.e.,
if its vertices can be linearly ordered by $<$ so that $i<j, s<r$ and $ir, js
\in A(H)$ imply that $is \in A(H)$ and $jr \in A(H)$. We give a forbidden
induced subgraph characterization of reflexive digraphs with a Min-Max
ordering; our characterization implies a polynomial time test for the existence
of a Min-Max ordering. Using this characterization, we show that for a
reflexive digraph $H$ which does not admit a Min-Max ordering, the minimum cost
homomorphism problem is NP-complete. Thus we obtain a full dichotomy
classification of the complexity of minimum cost homomorphism problems for
reflexive digraphs.

On the Complexity of the Minimum Cost Homomorphism Problem for Reflexive Multipartite Tournaments
2007-08-19

Gutin,G.
Kim,E. J.

For digraphs $D$ and $H$, a mapping $f: V(D)\dom V(H)$ is a homomorphism of
$D$ to $H$ if $uv\in A(D)$ implies $f(u)f(v)\in A(H).$ For a fixed digraph $H$,
the homomorphism problem is to decide whether an input digraph $D$ admits a
homomorphism to $H$ or not, and is denoted as HOMP($H$). Digraphs are allowed
to have loops, but not allowed to have parallel arcs.
  A natural optimization version of the homomorphism problem is defined as
follows. If each vertex $u \in V(D)$ is associated with costs $c_i(u), i \in
V(H)$, then the cost of the homomorphism $f$ is $\sum_{u\in V(D)}c_{f(u)}(u)$.
For each fixed digraph $H$, we have the {\em minimum cost homomorphism problem
for} $H$ and denote it as MinHOMP($H$). The problem is to decide, for an input
graph $D$ with costs $c_i(u),$ $u \in V(D), i\in V(H)$, whether there exists a
homomorphism of $D$ to $H$ and, if one exists, to find one of minimum cost.
  In a recent paper, we posed a problem of characterizing polynomial time
solvable and NP-hard cases of the minimum cost homomorphism problem for acyclic
multipartite tournaments with possible loops (w.p.l.). In this paper, we solve
the problem for reflexive multipartite tournaments and demonstrate a
considerate difficulty of the problem for the whole class of multipartite
tournaments w.p.l. using, as an example, acyclic 3-partite tournaments of order
4 w.p.l.\footnote{This paper was submitted to Discrete Mathematics on April 6,

Complexity of the Minimum Cost Homomorphism Problem for Semicomplete Digraphs with Possible Loops
2007-08-19

Kim,E. J.
Gutin,G.

For digraphs $D$ and $H$, a mapping $f: V(D)\dom V(H)$ is a homomorphism of
$D$ to $H$ if $uv\in A(D)$ implies $f(u)f(v)\in A(H).$ For a fixed digraph $H$,
the homomorphism problem is to decide whether an input digraph $D$ admits a
homomorphism to $H$ or not, and is denoted as HOM($H$).
  An optimization version of the homomorphism problem was motivated by a
real-world problem in defence logistics and was introduced in
\cite{gutinDAM154a}. If each vertex $u \in V(D)$ is associated with costs
$c_i(u), i \in V(H)$, then the cost of the homomorphism $f$ is $\sum_{u\in
V(D)}c_{f(u)}(u)$. For each fixed digraph $H$, we have the {\em minimum cost
homomorphism problem for} $H$ and denote it as MinHOM($H$). The problem is to
decide, for an input graph $D$ with costs $c_i(u),$ $u \in V(D), i\in V(H)$,
whether there exists a homomorphism of $D$ to $H$ and, if one exists, to find
one of minimum cost.
  Although a complete dichotomy classification of the complexity of MinHOM($H$)
for a digraph $H$ remains an unsolved problem, complete dichotomy
classifications for MinHOM($H$) were proved when $H$ is a semicomplete digraph
\cite{gutinDAM154b}, and a semicomplete multipartite digraph \cite{gutinDAM}.
In these studies, it is assumed that the digraph $H$ is loopless. In this
paper, we present a full dichotomy classification for semicomplete digraphs
with possible loops, which solves a problem in \cite{gutinRMS}.\footnote{This

Discrete Denoising with Shifts
2007-08-19

Moon,Taesup
Weissman,Tsachy

We introduce S-DUDE, a new algorithm for denoising DMC-corrupted data. The
algorithm, which generalizes the recently introduced DUDE (Discrete Universal
DEnoiser) of Weissman et al., aims to compete with a genie that has access, in
addition to the noisy data, also to the underlying clean data, and can choose
to switch, up to $m$ times, between sliding window denoisers in a way that
minimizes the overall loss. When the underlying data form an individual
sequence, we show that the S-DUDE performs essentially as well as this genie,
provided that $m$ is sub-linear in the size of the data. When the clean data is
emitted by a piecewise stationary process, we show that the S-DUDE achieves the
optimum distribution-dependent performance, provided that the same
sub-linearity condition is imposed on the number of switches. To further
substantiate the universal optimality of the S-DUDE, we show that when the
number of switches is allowed to grow linearly with the size of the data,
\emph{any} (sequence of) scheme(s) fails to compete in the above senses. Using
dynamic programming, we derive an efficient implementation of the S-DUDE, which
has complexity (time and memory) growing only linearly with the data size and
the number of switches $m$. Preliminary experimental results are presented,
suggesting that S-DUDE has the capacity to significantly improve on the
performance attained by the original DUDE in applications where the nature of
the data abruptly changes in time (or space), as is often the case in practice.
